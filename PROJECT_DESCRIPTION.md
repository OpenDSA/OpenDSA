### Project Description

This is the development repository for the OpenDSA project. The goal of the OpenDSA project is to create open-source courseware for use in Data Structures and Algorithms courses, that deeply integrates textbook-quality content with algorithm visualizations and interactive, automatically assessed exercises.

The project uses a Docker-based development environment to ensure consistency and ease of setup. The main components of the project include:

*   **Algorithm Visualizations (AVs):** Interactive visualizations of various data structures and algorithms.
*   **Interactive Exercises:** Automatically assessed exercises, many of which are based on the Khan Academy exercise framework.
*   **Textbook Content:** Course materials written in reStructuredText (RST) format.
*   **Build System:** A `Makefile`-based build system that compiles the RST content and associated visualizations and exercises into complete "textbooks".
