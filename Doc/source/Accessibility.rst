Accessibility
=============

Here are some things to keep in mind to make sure your books are accessible
to as many people as possible:

#. Make sure any <iframes> have a title parameter parameter.

#. Make sure all of your images have alttext parameters defined. 

#. System administrator: Someone who wants to set up their own copy of
   OpenDSA. OpenDSA separates the front end content delivery server
   from the back end data collection server. You might want to set up
   either or both, in which case you should look at the installation
   guides.

#. OpenDSA Infrastructure developer: If you want to help to extend the
   OpenDSA infrastructure, then you will need to understand the
   details of the part of the system that you are targetting.
