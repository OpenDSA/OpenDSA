General Trees
=============

General Trees
-------------

Many organizations are hierarchical in nature, such as the military
and most businesses.
Consider a company with a president and some number of vice presidents
who report to the president.
Each vice president has some number of direct subordinates, and so on.
If we wanted to model this company with a data structure,
it would be natural to think of the president
in the root node of a tree, the vice presidents at level 1, and their
subordinates at lower levels in the tree as we go
down the organizational hierarchy.

Because the number of vice presidents is likely to be more than two,
this company's organization cannot easily be represented by a
binary tree.
We need instead to use a tree whose nodes have an arbitrary
number of children.
Unfortunately, when we permit trees to have nodes with an arbitrary
number of children, they become much harder to implement than binary
trees.
We consider such trees in this chapter.
To distinguish them from binary trees,
we use the term :term:`general tree`.

In this module we will examine general tree terminology and define a
basic ADT for general trees.

General Tree Definitions and Terminology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A :term:`tree` :math:`\mathbf{T}` is a finite set of one or more nodes
such that there is one designated node :math:`R`, called the root
of :math:`\mathbf{T}`.
If the set :math:`(\mathbf{T} -\{R\})` is not empty, these nodes are
partitioned into :math:`n > 0` disjoint sets :math:`\mathbf{T}_0`,
:math:`\mathbf{T}_1`, ..., :math:`\mathbf{T}_{n-1}`, each of which is
a tree, and whose roots :math:`R_1, R_2, ..., R_n`,
respectively, are children of :math:`R`.
The subsets :math:`\mathbf{T}_i (0 \leq i < n)` are said to be
:term:`subtrees <subtree>` of :math:`\mathbf{T}`.
These subtrees are ordered in that :math:`\mathbf{T}_i` is said to
come before :math:`\mathbf{T}_j` if :math:`i < j`.
By convention, the subtrees are arranged from left to right with
subtree :math:`\mathbf{T}_0` called the leftmost child of :math:`R`.
A node's :term:`out degree` is the number of children for that node.
A :term:`forest` is a collection of one or more trees.
Figure :num:`Figure #GenTreeFig` presents further tree notation
generalized from the notation for binary trees.

   Notation for general trees.
   Node :math:`P` is the parent of nodes :math:`V`, :math:`S1`,
   and :math:`S2`.
   Thus, :math:`V`, :math:`S1`, and :math:`S2` are children
   of :math:`P`.
   Nodes :math:`R` and :math:`P` are ancestors of :math:`V`.
   Nodes :math:`V`, :math:`S1`, and :math:`S2` are called
   :term:`siblings <sibling>`.
   The oval surrounds the subtree having :math:`V` as its root.

Each node in a tree has precisely one parent, except for the root,
which has no parent.
From this observation, it immediately follows that a tree with
:math:`n` nodes must have :math:`n-1` edges because each node, aside
from the root, has one edge connecting that node to its parent.


An ADT for General Tree Nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before discussing general tree implementations, we should first make
precise what operations such implementations must support.
Any implementation must be able to initialize a tree.
Given a tree, we need access to the root of that tree.
There must be some way to access the children of a node.
In the case of the ADT for binary tree nodes, this was done by
providing member functions that give explicit access to the left and
right child pointers.
Unfortunately, because we do not know in advance how many children a
given node will have in the general tree, we cannot give explicit
functions to access each child.
An alternative must be found that works for an unknown number of
children.

One choice would be to provide a function that takes as its parameter
the index for the desired child.
That combined with a function that returns the number of children for
a given node would support the ability to access any node or process
all children of a node.
Unfortunately, this view of access tends to bias the
choice for node implementations in favor of an array-based approach,
because these functions favor random access to a list of children.
In practice, an implementation based on a linked list is often
preferred.

An alternative is to provide access to the first (or leftmost) child
of a node, and to provide access to the next (or right) sibling of a
node.
Here are the class declarations for general trees and
their nodes.
Based on these two access functions, the children of a node can be
traversed like a list.
Trying to find the next sibling of the rightmost sibling would return
``null``.

General Tree Traversals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are three traditional
:ref:`tree traversals <tree traversal> <BinaryTreeTraversal>`
for :term:`binary trees <binary tree>`:
:term:`preorder <preorder traversal>`,
:term:`postorder <postorder traversal>`,
and :term:`inorder <inorder traversal>`.
For general trees, preorder and postorder traversals are defined with
meanings similar to their binary tree
counterparts.
Preorder traversal of a general tree first visits the root of the
tree, then performs a preorder traversal of each subtree from left to
right.
A postorder traversal of a general tree performs a postorder traversal
of the root's subtrees from left to right, then visits the root.
Inorder traversal does not have a natural definition for the
general tree, because there is no particular number of children for an
internal node.
An arbitrary definition |---| such as visit the leftmost subtree in
inorder, then the root, then visit the remaining subtrees in inorder |---|
can be invented.
However, inorder traversals are generally not useful with
general trees.

To perform a preorder traversal, it is necessary to visit each of the
children for a given node (say :math:`R`) from left to right.
This is accomplished by starting at R's leftmost child
(call it :math:`T`).
From :math:`T`, we can move to :math:`T`'s right sibling, and then
to that node's right sibling, and so on.

Using the General Tree ADT shown above, here is an
implementation to print the nodes of a general tree in
preorder.
Note the `while` loop at the end, which processes the list of
children by beginning with the leftmost child, then repeatedly moving
to the next child until calling	``next`` returns ``null``.
