Relational Integrity Constraints
=======================
What Is Meant By Constraints?
_________________________

Are conditions that must hold on all valid relation instances. These conditions maintain database correctness by preventing errors and inconsistencies.


Advantage of Using Integrity Constraints
_________________________________

1- They ensure the **accuracy** of data by preventing invalid data from being entered into the database.

2- They maintain the **consistency** of data by ensuring that data is consistent across different tables and fields.

These advantages leads to a reliable database design.
