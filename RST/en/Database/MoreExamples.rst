Simple join Queries
===================

Click Handlers

interactive exercise you will need a click handler to support the
interaction with graphical elements on the canvas.

Exercise Stack
--------------

Demo for a special stack display style that gets used in some
exercises to show the user input values to be dealt with.

Automatic node resize
---------------------

Nodes more-or-less automatically resize to match the value
string.

.. TODO::
   :type: Visualization

   This would be better if there was padding on the string, and if it
   were better centered vertically. It also only works because we
   leave out lib/odsaStyle.css. This should get fixed to work with
   that. Finally, it ought to be a diagram, not a standalone AV.
   
MathJAX
-------

Examples of using MathJAX.
