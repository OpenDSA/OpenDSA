How to Draw ER Diagrams
Below points show how to go about creating an ER diagram.

Identify all the entities in the system. An entity should appear only once in a particular diagram. Create rectangles for all entities and name them properly.
Identify relationships between entities. Connect them using a line and add a diamond in the middle describing the relationship.
Add attributes for entities. Give meaningful attribute names so they can be understood easily.
Sounds simple right? In a complex system, it can be a nightmare to identify relationships. This is something youâ€™ll perfect only with practice.

**ER Diagram Best Practices**
Provide a precise and appropriate name for each entity, attribute, and relationship in the diagram. Terms that are simple and familiar always beats vague, technical-sounding words. In naming entities, remember to use singular nouns. However, adjectives may be used to distinguish entities belonging to the same class (part-time employee and full-time employee, for example). Meanwhile attribute names must be meaningful, unique, system-independent, and easily understandable.
Remove vague, redundant or unnecessary relationships between entities.
Never connect a relationship to another relationship.
