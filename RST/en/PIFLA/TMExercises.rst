   :description: A collection of exercises that require the user to create a Turing machine, with correctness assessed using test case.

Turing Machine Exercises
========================

Note: In these exercises, a blank space is indicated by a box or just
a blank in the field. These exercises do not recognize # as the space
character.

To complete adding an edge, the cursor needs to NOT be in the
direction field, but instead be in one of the first two fields.
Then, hit the 'enter' key.
