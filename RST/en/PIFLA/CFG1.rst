Context-Free Grammars Part 1
============================

Context-Free Languages 
----------------------

In previous chapters, we saw that some languages are regular
languages, which means that we can define a DFA, NFA that recognizes
that language, or we can represent it with a regular
expression or regular grammar.
Here are a few examples of regular languages:

* keywords in a programming language
* names of identifiers
* integers
* a finite list of miscillaneous symbols such as :math:`=`.

We also know that some languages are non-regular, and we learned how
to use tools like the Pumping Lemma to prove a given language is
non-regular.
Examples of non-regular languages include:

* :math:`\{a^ncb^n\ |\ n > 0\}`
* mathematical expressions like :math:`((a + b) - c)`
* block structures for programming languages (:math:`\{\}` in Java/C++
  and ``begin`` ... ``end`` in Pascal)
* Balanced parentheses

Now we will look at a class of languages that is larger than the class
of regular languages, called
:term:`context-free languages <context-free language>`
or :term:`CFG`.
Perhaps not surprisingly, a CFL is any language that can be
represented by a :term:`context-free grammar` or :term:`CFG`.
