Grammar Exercises
-----------------

Note: For these exercises, non-terminals are assumed to be single capital
letters, and the start symbol is whatever non-terminal (a single capital
letter) is on the left side of the first rule.
There can be only one production per rule, so you may not have a rule
like :math:`S \rightarrow a | b`.
Instead, you need to use a separate row for each production,
like :math:`S \rightarrow a` and :math:`S \rightarrow b`.
If you want a production to go to :math:`\lambda`, then click in the
box, leave it empty, and click outside the box.

Occasionally, it can take the autograder a little while to run for an
exercise, so give it some time (up to a minute) if it seems like there
is no response.
