Relations
=========

Relations
---------

Hopefully you found the material on sets in the last module fairly
simple, and maybe familiar from previous courses.
If you have had a discrete math class, than you are probably also
familiar with the concept of relations.
But unlike basic set notation, most people have a lot of trouble
understanding the concept of a relation (many overthink the idea), and
even more trouble with the different classifications.
So we will cover the basics in some detail, and follow up with some
practice exercises.
