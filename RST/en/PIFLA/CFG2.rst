help you to convince yourself when a grammar is not ambiguous.

Why Context Free?
-----------------

We have been throwing around the term "context free" to describe
certain languages and their associated grammars.
We have a definitions: A context-free language is one with a
context-free grammar, and a context-free grammar is any grammar whose
production rules all have a single variable on the left-hand side.
Finally, we know that the class of context free languages is a
superset of the class of regular languages.

But why the name "context free"?
This comes from the idea that, in a sentential form for a partial
derivation for a string, we are free to replace any variable with one
of its production rule right-hand sides, without concern for what else
appears in that sentential form.
For example, consider a grammar that has these rules:

   | S :math:`\rightarrow` ABC :math:`|` GBH
   | B :math:`\rightarrow` E :math:`+` E

The point is that regardless of which production rule we use on S to
start, we are then free to expand B in the next step, regardless of
whether it is surrounded by variables A and C, or by variables G
and H.

In contrast, there are also context-sensitive grammars.
These are grammars that can have multiple variables on the left hand
side of a production.
For example, consider this partial grammar:

   | S :math:`\rightarrow` ABC :math:`|` GBH
   | AB :math:`\rightarrow` AE :math:`+` E
   | GB :math:`\rightarrow` AE :math:`-` E

In this case, we have to see A and B appear together in the sentential form
in order to fire the production rule that yields E :math:`+` E,
or G and B appear together to fire the production rule that yields
E :math:`-` E.

We will see later that context-sensitive grammars are more powerful
than CFGs.
Which of course means that there are languages that are not context
free, but which are context sensitive.
