DFA Complement Exercise
=======================

.. .. DO NOT USE: These are obsolete. Each of the DFA exercise sets
   has a complement exercise included that complements one of the
   machines already in the exercise.
   
DFA Complement Exercise 1
-------------------------

HINT: If DFA :math:`M` accepts language :math:`L`, the we can create a
machine to accept the complement of :math:`L` by reversing the final
and non-final states of :math:`M`.
However, that only works on a complete DFA, meaning that we have to
take into account the trap state.

DFA Complement Exercise 2
-------------------------

HINT: If DFA :math:`M` accepts language :math:`L`, the we can create a
machine to accept the complement of :math:`L` by reversing the final
and non-final states of :math:`M`.
However, that only works on a complete DFA, meaning that we have to
