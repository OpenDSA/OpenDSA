Introduction
============

This book assumes that you are already familiar with the
`Python <http://www.python.org>`_ programming language. We will use
Python as a starting point for our journey into
`Java <http://java.sun.com>`_. We will begin by looking at a very simple
Java program, just to see what the language looks like and how we get a
program to run. Next, we will look at the main constructs that are
common to most programming languages:

    -  Data Types

    -  Loops

    -  Reading user input

    -  Conditionals

Once we have the basics of Java behind us we will move on to look at the
features of Java that are both unique and powerful.

.. note::
    We'll (the instructors) add comments and tips throughout that will help connect the readings
    to class!
