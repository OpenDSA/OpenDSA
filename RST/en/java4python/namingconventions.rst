Naming Conventions
==================

Java has some very handy naming conventions.

-  Class names always start with an upper case letter. For example,
   ``Scanner``, ``System``, ``Hello``

-  Method names always start with a lower case letter, and use camelCase
   to represent multiword method names. for example ``nextInt()``

-  Instance variables of a class start with a lower case letter and use
   camelCase

-  Constants are in all upper case letters. for example ``Math.MAXINT``
