Colophon
========

I started writing this article in 2006 using Pythonâ€™s restructured text.
In 2007 I switched to markdown since everything else I was writing used
markdown. In particular I switched to the variant of markdown used by
the excellent `pandoc <http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/>`_ program.
Pandoc does an excellent job of converting markdown to html, latex, pdf,
and other formats. The markdown source for this article is available
`here <http://www.cs.luther.edu/~bmiller/JavaForPython.md>`_. Finally
the document became so big that I used ``pandoc`` to convert it to latex
for preparing the final version. I used The ``htlatex`` program to
generate html for the online version of this document.

Shameless Plug
--------------

If you got this far, I would also like to use this space as a shameless
plug for two books. At Luther college we use Python for CS1 and CS2.
When we decided to make the switch to introducing CS with Python we
wanted to provide our students with two semesters of Python. The reason
is that after one semester students are just getting comfortable with
the language and it does not make sense to push them into a brand new
language just as they are getting some comfort. The second reason is
that Python really is a great language for teaching data structures. The
language makes the algorithms evident by clearing away all of the
syntactic clutter. So we (David Ranum and I) wrote a CS2 book called
`Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using
Python <http://www.amazon.com/Problem-Solving-Algorithms-Structures-Python/dp/1590280539>`_.
After we finished the CS2 book we decided to write our own CS1 book as
well. This book will be available for Fall 2008 classes from Jones and
Bartlett publishers. The tentative title is *Python in Context*. Please
feel free to contact me for more information.
