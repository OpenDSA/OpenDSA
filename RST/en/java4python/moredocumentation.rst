Java Documentation
==================

All Java class libraries are documented and available online. Here are
two good resources for you to use:

-  `JavaDoc <http://www.javadoconline.com>`_ The Javadoconline website
   provides a nice searchable interface. Search for a classname and you
   will get the documentation you are looking for.

-  `JavaAPI <http://knuth.luther.edu/Javadoc/docs/api/index.html>`_
   contains the same information but in a browsable format. If you donâ€™t
   know the class name exactly this is a good way to see what is close.

In general the Javadoc page for any class contains information about:

-  Where this class falls in the class hierarchy. What classes are its
   parents and what classes are its decendents.

-  A summary and some examples of using the class.

-  A summary listing of instance variables

-  A summary listing of Constructors

-  A summary listing of Methods

-  Detailed documentation on constructors and methods.

Typically the Javadoc pages are constructed from the source code where
the class is implemented. This encourages Java programmers to do a good
job of documenting their code, while providing a user friendly way to
read the documentation without looking at the code directly.
