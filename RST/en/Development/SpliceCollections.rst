Fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms
==========================================

Introduction to Data Structures
-------------------------------

Data structures are the foundation of efficient programming and algorithm design.
They determine how data is organized, accessed, and manipulated.
In this section, we will explore key data structures such as **Lists, 2D Arrays, Linked lists and Graphs** and their applications in search and retrieval.


**Insert Practice Exercise**

Understanding how to efficiently insert elements in an array-based list is crucial for building dynamic data structures.
