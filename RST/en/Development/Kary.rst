K-ary Tree Implementations
==========================

K-ary Tree Implementations
--------------------------

:math:`K`-ary trees are trees whose internal nodes all have exactly
:math:`K` children.
Thus, a full binary tree is a 2-ary tree.
The PR Quadtree discussed in Module :numref:`<Spatial>` is an example
of a 4-ary tree.
Because :math:`K`-ary tree nodes have a fixed number of children,
unlike general trees, they are relatively easy to implement.
In general, :math:`K`-ary trees bear many similarities to binary
trees, and similar implementations can be used for :math:`K`-ary tree
nodes.
Note that as :math:`K` becomes large, the potential number of ``null``
pointers grows, and the difference between the required sizes for
internal nodes and leaf nodes increases.
Thus, as :math:`K` becomes larger, the need to choose separate
implementations for the internal and leaf nodes becomes more
pressing.

Full K-ary trees and complete K-ary trees are analogous
to full and complete binary trees, respectively.

   for K=3. In practice, most applications of \Kary\ trees limit them
   to be either full or complete.

Many of the properties of binary trees extend to :math:`K`-ary trees.
Equivalent theorems to those in Module numref`<BinSpace>` regarding the
number of ``null`` pointers in a :math:`K`-ary tree and the
relationship between the number of leaves and the number of internal
nodes in a :math:`K`-ary tree can be derived.
We can also store a complete :math:`K`-ary tree in an array,
using simple formulas to compute a node's relations in a manner
similar to that used in
Section :numref:`<CompleteTree>`.
