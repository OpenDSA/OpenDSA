Variable Scoping
========================


Variable Scoping
----------------

This section discusses exactly where a user-defined name can be accessed. The *scope* of a user-defined name is the region of
source code where the name is visible and can be used.


Local Scope
~~~~~~~~~~~

Recall that mutator methods (or "setters" as they're often called) are used to
change the values of private fields in a class.  For example:

.. code-block:: java

   public class Cat
   {
       private String color;

       // ...

       public void setColor(String newColor)
       {
            color = newColor;
       }
   }

This  ``setColor()`` method makes use of both a field and a parameter.
It is important to note that there is a difference in where these two types
of variables can be used. The **scope** of a variable or method refers to where
it can be used in a program.

A parameter’s scope is limited to the body of the method in which it is
declared.  Parameters are local variables
which are declared in the parameter list of a method’s header and which
have initial values specified by the arguments in a method call.  For example,
if we had an object of type ``Cat`` called ``c``, we could call
the ``setColor()`` method like so:

.. code-block:: java

   c.setColor("Black");

When we write the method, we declare the variable ``newColor``, and when we call
the method here,
we set ``s`` equal to the string "Black".  If we wanted to call the method
again, we would need to provide a new value for the variable ``newColor``.

.. code-block:: java

   c.setColor("Black");
   c.setColor("Grey");

Such values do not carry over between method calls.

The scope of a parameter is the
same as the scope of a variable declared at the
very beginning of the body of a method.   Once the flow of execution leaves a
method, its parameters and other local variables cease to exist. The scope
of local variables is referred to as **local scope**.

**Local Variables.** Local variables, that is, parameters and variables declared in the body of a method, have **local scope** which extends from the point at which they are defined to the end of the block of code in which they are defined. In particular, the scope of a parameter is the entire body of the method in which it is declared.

It would be a syntax error to refer to a method's parameters or other local variables from outside the method.

Block-Level Scope
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Variables that are declared in the body of a method have scope
which extends from the point where they are declared to the end
of the **block** of code in which they are declared.  When a local variable
is declared at the beginning of a method, it has the local scope discussed
above.

However, local variables are not restricted to the beginning of a method, and
their declarations can be placed elsewhere, which can affect their scope.  When
control structures
like if-statements or loops are involved, scope can be a bit more specific.

.. code-block:: java

   public void exampleMethod(int x)
   {
       if (x % 2 == 0)
       {
           int value = 4;
       }
       value = value + 2; // This will not work!
   }

Variables declared inside the curly braces (``{}``) of a control structure
like a loop or conditional only exist within those curly braces.  The method
above would not work as the variable ``value`` is only declared and initialized
inside the if statement's true branch, and that variable ceases to exist when
the corresponding closing brace marking the end of the if statement's true
branch is reached. As a result, its name is no longer visible once execution
has left the block (the pair of braces) where it is declared. Any attempt to
use the variable outside of the braces where it is declared will result in a
compiler error, since the variable is no longer visible or accessible--no longer
"in scope".

The same is true for looping structures:

.. code-block:: java

   for (int i = 0; i < 12; i++)
   {
       System.out.println(i);
   }
   i = i + 1; // This will not work!

The variable ``i`` is defined as part of the for loop and its scope is the
body of the for loop--the braces surrounding the loop's body. The variable ``i``
ceases to exist after the for loop is finished.

To get around this issue, you will sometimes see code where a variable
is declared *before* a control structure, so that it can be accessed inside
the control structure and also after it.

.. code-block:: java

   public void exampleMethod(int x)
   {
       int value = 0;
       if (x % 2 == 0)
       {
           value = 4;
       }
       value = value + 2;
   }

We could also do something similar with a for loop:

.. code-block:: java

   int i = 0;
   for (i = 0; i < 12; i++)
   {
       System.out.println(i);
   }
   i = i + 1; // This will work!


Class Scope
~~~~~~~~~~~

By contrast, fields and all methods have scope that extends throughout the
entire class, that is, **class scope**. They
can be used in the body of any method and in the expressions that assign
initial values to class level variables.

**Class-Level Variables.** Fields and methods have class scope, which extends throughout the class.


A Common Misconception
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After declaring a variable it is tempting to use to both the variable name and
the variable's type whenever referring to it.  For example:

.. code-block:: java

    public class Cat
    {
        private String color;

        // ...

        public void setColor(String newColor)
        {
             String color = newColor;
        }
    }

This setter will **not** change the value of the field ``color``.  To Java,
whenever the type of a variable is included, you are declaring a variable.
Java will allow you to declare variables with the same name, as long as they
are in different scopes.
In the code above, there is a field called ``color`` with class-level
scope, *and* a local variable called ``color`` that only exists within
the ``setColor()`` method.

Even though these variables have the same name and type, they are different. Changing one will not change the other.  

.. TL: Comment out CatTest example.
.. Another common example of this can be
.. seen when testing.  Let's look at a hypothetical test file for our ``Cat`` class.

.. .. code-block:: java

..     public class CatTest
..         extends TestCase
..     {
..         private Cat testCat;

..         public void setUp()
..         {
..             Cat testCat = new Cat();
..         }

..         public void test1()
..         {
..             testCat.setColor("White");
..         }
..     }

.. This is the same issue as we saw in the previous example.
.. There is a class-level ``Cat`` object declared as a field (``private Cat testCat;``).
.. But, instead of initializing the field inside ``setUp()``, we also
.. have a local variable being declared, also called ``testCat``.  This means
.. the field ``testCat`` will not be initialized, since the object created inside
.. ``setUp()`` is being used to initialize the local variable inside that method,
.. which will cease to exist when the method ends.  When
.. we refer to the ``testCat`` variable in ``test1()``, we refer to the field,
.. which was never initialized and will therefore contain ``null``.  Thus, this
.. test will produce a ``NullPointerException``.

.. Fortunately, the problem is easily fixed.  Once a variable has been declared,
.. we only need to refer to it by the variable's name.

.. .. code-block:: java

..     public class CatTest
..         extends TestCase
..     {
..         private Cat testCat;

..         public void setUp()
..         {
..             testCat = new Cat();
..         }

..         public void test1()
..         {
..             testCat.setColor("White"); // this won't work!
..         }
..     }

.. This code would run without error. The field ``testCat`` is still declared
.. outside any method, giving it a class-level scope.  But this time, it is
.. initialized in our ``setUp()`` method correctly, and ``setUp()``
.. runs before every test.  This means that in ``test1()``, ``testCat`` would
.. refer to a ``Cat`` object, not the value ``null``.


A Note on Naming
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As we saw above, Java can handle having two variables with the same name
and type when they are declared in different scopes.  This can also lead to
confusion.  For example, we could
have two String variables called ``color``.  One a field and one a parameter.

.. code-block:: java

    public class Cat
    {
        private String color;

        // ...

        public void setColor(String color)
        {
             color = color;
        }
    }

This code would compile but it is not advisable to use such naming conventions.
This is because it is not clear if the field ``color`` is being set to the
parameter ``color`` or vice-versa, or something else entirely.  Let's take a
look at what is happening here by adding a few print statements:


.. code-block:: java

    public class Cat
    {
        private String color;

        public Cat()
        {
            this.color = "Black";
        }

        public void setColor(String color)
        {
            color = color;
            System.out.println(this.color);
            System.out.println(color);
        }

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Cat cat = new Cat();
            cat.setColor("Green");
        }
    }

In this example, whenever we make a new ``Cat`` object, the value of the
field ``color`` is set to "Black" at first.  When we run the main method with ``setColor("Green")`` we see an interesting result in our print statements:

::
    
    $ javac Cat.java 
    $ java Cat 
    Black
    Green


The first thing to be printed out is ``this.color``.  Which we see is "Black".
The value of the field was not changed to "Green"! This means that when we write
``color = color`` we know that the field color was not on the left side of
the assignment operator.

One might assume, then, that the parameter ``color`` is the value on the left
side of the assignment operator.  This would mean that the parameter was changed
from "Green" to "Black". But our second print statement tells us otherwise.
When we print out the parameter ``color`` we see it is still "Green".  This
means that the field ``color`` was not on the right side of the equals
sign either!

What happened in this code is that we set the parameter variable ``color``
equal to itself--meaning nothing changed!

Generally, the best way to avoid such confusion is to give your variables
distinct names like we did initially:


.. code-block:: java

    public void setColor(String newColor)
    {
        color = newColor;
    }



Alternately, if for some reason you *must* use the same variable name at two
different scope levels, using the modifier ``this`` will help clarify which
variable you are referring to:

.. code-block:: java

    public void setColor(String color)
    {
        this.color = color;
    }

Now, the field ``color`` is on the left side of the assignment operator and the
parameter ``color`` is on the right.  So, if we ran ``setColor("Green");``
the field ``color`` would be changed from "Black" to "Green".

You will sometimes see this convention in setter methods or constructors,
where the programmer has intentionally used the same name for both the
parameter and the field, to communicate the intent that the parameter is
the value that will be stored in the field. When using this approach it
is mandatory to alway include ``this.`` as a prefix when referring to the
field name, because otherwise, all uses of the name would refer to the
parameter only.

Syntax Practice: Scoping

.. Java Input and Output
.. ---------------------

.. We have been using ``System.out.println()`` for a while, but you might not
.. have thought about what it means. ``System`` is a class that provides methods
.. related to the "system" or environment where programs run. It also provides
.. ``System.out``, which is a special field that refers to an object providing
.. methods for displaying output, including ``println()``.
.. In fact, we can use ``System.out.println()`` to display the value
.. of ``System.out``:


.. .. code-block:: java

..    System.out.println(System.out);

.. The result is:

.. .. code-block::

..    java.io.PrintStream@685d72cd

.. This output indicates that ``System.out`` refers to a ``PrintStream`` object,
.. which is defined in a package called ``java.io``. A package is a collection of
.. related classes; ``java.io`` contains classes for "I/O" which stands for
.. *input and output*.


.. Basic Input and Output Concepts
.. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. Java provides an extensive library of classes for managing input and output of
.. all forms of data.  In Java, any source or destination for I/O is considered
.. a "stream" or sequence of bytes or characters. To perform output, we insert
.. bytes or characters into the stream. To perform input, we extract bytes or
.. characters from the stream.  Even characters entered at a keyboard (if we
.. think about them as a sequence of keystrokes) can be represented as a stream.

.. **Input** operations are framed in terms of reading from a stream in a
.. three-step process:

.. 1. open the stream
.. 2. read data items from the stream front to back in sequence
.. 3. close the stream.

.. **Output** operations are framed in terms of writing to a stream in a
.. similar three-step process:

.. 1. open the stream
.. 2. write data onto the end of the stream in sequence
.. 3. close the stream.

.. To use Java's input/output classes, make sure that in addition to importing
.. any other necessary packages, also import the ``java.io`` package and
.. the ``java.util`` package:

.. .. code-block:: java

..    import java.io.*;
..    import java.util.*;


.. Output Using PrintWriters
.. -------------------------

.. Opening a Stream for Output
.. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. In this class, we will only deal with textual, human-readable output. The main
.. class we will use for generating output is Java's ``PrintWriter`` class, from
.. the ``java.io`` package. To create a ``PrintWriter``, we'll use a utility
.. method in the ``IOHelper`` class from the VT student package
.. (``import student.*;``\ ):

.. .. code-block:: java

..    PrintWriter outStream = IOHelper.createPrintWriter("output.txt");

.. This line declares a new variable, ``outStream`` and creates a new ``PrintWriter``
.. object that sends output to a brand new file in the file system. If a file with
.. the name already exists in the project directory it will be deleted before a new
.. empty file with the same name is created.

.. The ``PrintWriter`` object provides formatting and conversion operations.
.. A ``PrintWriter`` object is designed to send its output to a stream. It does
.. not know (or care) whether the stream is connected to a disk file or a network
.. connection or another device. The ``IOHelper`` class provides a few other
.. methods for creating ``PrintWriter`` objects, including methods that append to
.. an existing file instead of overwriting it, or streams that are connected to
.. the console for output.


.. Writing to an Output Stream
.. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. Three basic methods provided by ``PrintWriter`` objects provide virtually all
.. of the output capabilities you will need in this course:

.. * ``<stream>.print(<value>);`` writes the specified <value> to the given
..   <stream>. There are actually many versions of this method that support every
..   possible type of <value> you might want to print.

.. * ``<stream>.println(<value>);`` writes the specified <value> to the given
..   <stream>, and then follows it by writing a 'line terminator' to mark the end
..   of the current line (Java writes an appropriate line termination character
..   sequence based on the current operating system's text file format
..   conventions). As with ``print()``, you can provide any type of value
..   to ``println()``. You can even call ``println()`` without giving any argument
..   at all, for example, to terminate the current line after several
..   previous ``print()`` messages.

.. * ``<stream>.write(<value>);`` writes a single character specified by an
..   integer <value>. This operation is most often used when you are producing
..   output one character at a time, rather than in larger chunks. However, if
..   you pass an entire ``String`` value to ``write()`` instead of an ``int``
..   value, then the entire string will be written to the ``PrintWriter()`` just
..   as if you had used ``print()``.

.. For example:

.. .. code-block:: java

..    outStream.print("This is a message, and ");
..    outStream.println("these words appear on the same line as those above");
..    outStream.println(100 / 2);  // prints the value "50"
..    outStream.write(65);         // writes the letter 'A', whose ASCII code is 65


.. Closing a Stream
.. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. Once you have completed all of the operations you intend to carry out on a given
.. stream, the stream should be closed. Closing the stream frees up operating system
.. resources used to connect to and communicate with the stream, and makes sure that
.. any buffered data you have written to the stream is flushed out to the physical
.. device involved (if any).

.. Closing a stream is easy:

.. .. code-block:: java

..    outStream.close();

.. You should close both input streams and output streams this way. In many simple
.. programs, a good rule of thumb is to make sure that the method that creates the
.. stream should also be the one responsible for closing it.


.. A Complete Output Example
.. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. We can put all these pieces together to show how to generate output to a file,
.. for example. Let's say we want to create a file called ``output.txt`` containing
.. some output from our program. We can do it in one method like this (don't
.. forget to import ``java.io.*`` in your class):

.. .. code-block:: java

..    public void printResultFile(int result)
..    {
..        PrintWriter out = IOHelper.createPrintWriter("output.txt");
..        out.println("This is the first line of output.");
..        out.print("The result is: ");
..        out.print(result);
..        out.println();
..        out.close();
..    }

.. If called with a specific argument, like ``printResultFile(42);``, the method
.. will produce a file called ``output.txt`` in your BlueJ project directory
.. containing these lines:

.. .. code-block:: java

..    This is the first line of output.
..    The result is: 42

.. At other times, when there is a lot of output to produce, you may want to place
.. all the ``println()`` calls in one or more other methods. Then you can pass a
.. ``PrintWriter`` object as a parameter, as in this example:

.. .. code-block:: java

..    public void printResultFile()
..    {
..        PrintWriter out = IOHelper.createPrintWriter("output.txt");
..        printHeader(out);
..        printData(out);
..        out.close();
..    }

..    public void printHeader(PrintWriter outStream)
..    {
..        outStream.println("This is the output for ...");
..        // other output commands go here.
..    }

..    public void printData(PrintWriter outStream)
..    {
..        outStream.print(/* ... */);
..        // more, as needed ...
..    }


.. Output with System.out
.. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. It turns out that printing to the terminal is such a common action that Java
.. provides a pre-initialized output stream just for that purpose, called
.. ``System.out``. The advantage of ``System.out`` is that it is already declared
.. and always ready for use, and your program is not responsible for closing it.
.. As a result, you can directly call ``print()``, ``println()``, or ``write()``
.. on ``System.out`` anywhere you like.

.. .. code-block:: java

..    System.out.println("beginning the code ...");
..    ...
..    if (someCondition())
..    {
..        System.out.println("someCondition() is true");
..        x = ...;
..        System.out.println("x = " + x);
..    }
..    else
..    {
..        System.out.println("someCondition() is false");
..        y = ...;
..        System.out.println("y = " + y);
..    }

.. Above, notice the way the plus operator (``+``) was used to combine a textual
.. string with another value to make a larger message. This is a nice feature of
.. Java--the plus operator works to "concatenate" two strings into a larger string
.. by placing one after the other. Further, when you concatenate a string with
.. any other type of value, the other value is converted into a human-readable
.. string representation first by calling its ``toString()`` method.

.. * As a result, here are some recommendations for output in this course:

.. * When you just want to produce simple messages in the terminal window to help
..   debug a problem with your code, use ``System.out``.

.. * When you just want to interactively prompt the user for some value(s),
..   use ``System.out``.

.. * When your program is supposed to produce a series of output lines in a file,
..   use a ``PrintWriter``.

.. * When your program is supposed to produce a series of output lines that may
..   go either to the terminal window or to a file, write one or more methods
..   that use a ``PrintWriter`` provided as a parameter. You can always call such
..   a method and provide it with a ``PrintWriter`` produced with a ``System.out``
..   stream in order to produce output on the screen (see
..   the ``IOHelper.createConsoleWriter()`` method). Alternatively, you can pass
..   in a ``PrintWriter`` connected to a file instead (or even one connected to
..   an internet socket for communicating with another program on another
..   machine!).

.. Input Using Scanners
.. --------------------

.. Opening a Stream for Input
.. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. The main class we will use for reading input is Java's ``Scanner`` class, from
.. the ``java.io package``. Creating a ``Scanner`` is simple:

.. .. code-block:: java

..    Scanner inStream = IOHelper.createScanner("input.txt");

.. This line declares a new name, ``inStream`` and creates a Scanner object that
.. reads characters from the named file. The ``createScanner()`` method opens
.. files using path names relative to your project directory, so the file
.. called ``input.txt`` should be located there.
.. You can provide a fully qualified path name instead of a relative path name
.. if you desire.

.. The ``java.io`` package offers a rich inheritance hierarchy of classes for
.. reading from text files. The ``Scanner`` class was created to simplify text
.. input and is thus preferred over the other classes.


.. Reading from an Input Stream
.. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. Several methods provided by
.. `Scanner <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html>`_
.. objects provide virtually all of the input capabilities you will need in
.. this course:

.. * ``<scanner>.hasNext();`` Returns ``true`` if this scanner has another
..   token in its input.

.. * ``<scanner>.next();`` Finds and returns the next complete token
..   (by default the next whitespace delimited string as a String object like
..   the next line or next tab-seperated word) from this scanner.
..   A ``NoSuchElementException``
..   is thrown if no more tokens are available, (i.e., you have reached the end
..   of input).

.. * ``<scanner>.hasNextLine();`` Returns ``true`` if this scanner has another
..   line in its input.

.. * ``<scanner>.nextLine();`` Finds and returns the next complete line.
..   A ``NoSuchElementException``
..   is thrown if no more tokens are available, (i.e., you have reached the end
..   of input).

.. * ``<scanner>.hasNext<PrimitiveType>();`` The ``<PrimitiveType>`` can be
..   replaced by ``double``, ``float``, ``int``, etc. Returns ``true`` if this
..   scanner has another token in its input and it can be interpreted as a value
..   of the ``<PrimitiveType>``.

.. * ``<scanner>.next<PrimitiveType>();`` he ``<PrimitiveType>`` can be
..   replaced by ``double``, ``float``, ``int``, etc.  The method scans the next
..   token of the input as an ``<PrimitiveType>`` and returns back the
..   corresponding ``<PrimitiveType>`` value. It throws an ``InputMismatchException``
..   if the next token does not match the ``<PrimitiveType>``, or if the value
..   scanned is out of range. It also throws
..   a ``NoSuchElementException``
..   if no more tokens are available.

.. * ``<scanner>.useDelimiter(String pattern);`` by default whitespace (spaces,
..   tabs, or new line characters) are used as delimiters for separating the input
..   into tokens to return. This method allows the user to set the delimiter characters
..   to whatever they wish for breaking up the input.  Commas are a common other
..   delimiter to use as tables or data is often stored in what are called CSV
..   (comma seperated value) files.

.. * ``<scanner>.close();`` closes the scanner to release system resources being
..   used by the scanner.

.. To use these methods, normally you will process the input by scanning one line
.. at a time and then scanning the line for the desired tokens.

.. For example:

.. .. code-block:: java

..    Scanner inStream = IOHelper.createScanner("input.txt");
..    // if NOT at the end of the stream, more input is available
..    if (inStream.hasNextLine())
..    {
..        // Get an entire line
..        String thisLine = inStream.nextLine();
..        // Create a scanner to process the line
..        Scanner line = new Scanner(thisLine);
..        // Check for the next whitespace delimited int
..        if (line.hasNextInt())
..        {
..            System.out.println(line.nextInt());
..        }
..    }
..    inStream.close();

.. Notice how the existence of each input is checked before it is extracted to
.. avoid exceptions.

.. Also, if you have programmed in another language before, note that characters
.. in Java are encoded using unicode, a 16-bit character code. Programmers in
.. other languages may instead be familiar with ASCII, the
.. American Standard Code for Information Interchange, which is a 7-bit character
.. code. Fortunately, the first 128 codes in unicode are equivalent to the entire
.. `ASCII character set <https://www.asciitable.com/>`_ . For American users, ASCII
.. values may thus be freely used when reading and writing character-by-character
.. without error, although this approach does not directly extend to programs
.. written for an international audience.

.. The Scanner class can be used to read from any input stream, including files,
.. the keyboard through the terminal window, or even URLs. To read from the
.. keyboard, for example:

.. .. code-block:: java

..    Scanner keyBoard = IOHelper.createKeyboardScanner();

..    System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
..    // Prompt the user String name = keyBoard.nextLine();
..    System.out.println("Hello " + name); // Echo input

.. When performing interactive keyboard input there is no need to check for the
.. existence of the next token. The scanner will automatically block (i.e., wait)
.. for the user to enter input.

.. Scanners can also be used to read from a file that is publicly available on the
.. Web if you know the URL:

.. .. code-block:: java

..    Scanner inWebFile = IOHelper.createScannerForURL(
..        "http://server.subdomain.domain/dir/file.txt");
..    while (inWebFile.hasNextLine())
..    {
..        String line = inWebFile.nextLine();
..        System.out.println(line); // Echo input
..    }
..    inWebFile.close();

.. A Complete Input Example
.. ------------------------

.. We can put all these pieces together to show how to read input from a file one
.. character at a time, for example. Let's say we want to read the characters
.. from a file called ``input.txt``. We can do it in one method like this (don't
.. forget to ``import java.io.*`` and ``java.util.*`` in your class):

.. .. code-block:: java

..    public void readChars()
..    {
..        Scanner in = IOHelper.createScanner("input.txt");
..        // while NOT at the end of the stream, more input is available
..        while (in.hasNextLine())
..        {
..            String thisLine = in.nextLine(); // Get an entire line
..            for (int index = 0; index < thisLine.length(); index++)
..            {
..                char ch = thisLine.charAt(index);
..                System.out.print(ch);
..            }
..            System.out.println();
..        }
..        in.close();
..    }

.. At other times, when there is a lot of output to produce, you may want to place
.. all the ``read()`` calls in one or more other methods. Then you can pass a
.. ``Scanner`` object as a parameter:

.. .. code-block:: java

..    public void processInputFile()
..    {
..        Scanner in = IOHelper.createScanner("input.txt");
..        readHeader(in);
..        readData(in);
..        in.close();
..    }

..    public void readHeader(Scanner inStream)
..    {
..        String nextLine = null;
..        if (inStream.hasNextLine())
..        {
..            nextLine = inStream.nextLine();
..            // other input commands go here.
..        }
..    }

..    public void readData(Scanner inStream)
..    {
..        String nextLine = null;
..        if (inStream.hasNext() )
..        {
..            nextLine = inStream.nextLine();
..            // more, as needed ...
..        }
..    }

.. A Complete Input/Output Example
.. -------------------------------

.. Often, it is necessary to combine the processes of reading from some source
.. and writing to some destination. Here is a simple example that copies an input
.. file character by character:

.. .. code-block:: java

..    import cs1705.*;
..    import java.io.*;
..    import java.util.*;


..    // -------------------------------------------------------------------------
..    /**
..     * Shows how to read/write a file one character at a time.
..     * @author Dwight Barnette
..     * @version 2006.03.09
..     */
..    public class CopyFileByLine
..    {
..        // ----------------------------------------------------------
..        /**
..         * Copy the source file to the specified destination file.
..         * @param fromFile the name of the file to copy from
..         * @param toFile the name of the file to copy to
..         */
..        public void copyFile(String fromFile, String toFile)
..        {
..            Scanner source = IOHelper.createScanner(inFile);
..            PrintWriter dest = IOHelper.createPrintWriter(toFile);

..            while (source.hasNextLine())
..            {
..                String thisLine = source.nextLine();
..                for (int index = 0; index < thisLine.length(); index++)
..                {
..                    char ch = thisLine.charAt(index);
..                    dest.print(ch);
..                }
..                dest.println();
..            }
..            source.close();
..            dest.close();
..        }
..    }


.. Testing I/O-based Operations
.. ----------------------------

.. When it comes to testing, remember to write one or more test cases for each
.. method that your write in your solution. Preferably, you should write these tests
.. before (or as) you write the method itself, rather than saving testing until
.. your code works. As you work on larger and larger programs, it is important to
.. build skills in convincing yourself that the parts you have already written
.. work as you intend, even if the full solution has not been completed.

.. For testing programs that read input or produce output, it seems difficult when
.. the program operates directly on the console, since it is hard to "assert" what
.. should come out on the screen. Plus you would always need to be present to
.. "type in" the required input sequence.

.. To make these tests fully automated, however, don't write tests that use
.. ``System.out`` or that read from an external source. Instead, simply create a
.. ``Scanner`` to read from a fixed input string as part of your test case.
.. For output, create a ``PrintWriter`` that can write to a String object instead of the console.

.. To make these tasks easy, the ``TestCase`` base class from which all your test
.. cases inherit provides a few helper methods for you:

.. * ``setIn(<contents>);`` takes a string and uses it to create a ``Scanner``
..   for your test to use as input. The scanner gets cleared automatically
..   before each test case, so you can call this in ``setUp()`` if you want to
..   use the same input sequence for all your tests.

.. * ``in();`` returns the current ``Scanner`` being used for input. You can use
..   this, in combination with ``setIn()`` to set up an input stream for your own
..   input-based methods inside test cases. The scanner gets cleared automatically
..   at the start of each test case.

.. * ``out();`` returns a ``PrintWriter`` that you can use for output.
..   This ``PrintWriter`` captures all of its own output for later use in
..   assertions, and its contents are reset before each test case.

.. As an example, consider the following test method (which assumes your text fixture
.. includes a ``doIt`` object created from some DoIt class that provides a
.. method called ``processSomeInput()`` that accepts a ``Scanner``  parameter):

.. .. code-block:: java

..    public void testProcessSomeInput()
..    {
..        // set up the input stream
..        setIn("some test input");

..        // run the method to get results
..        doIt.processSomeInput(in());

..        // test that the result is what was expected
..        assertThat( ... );
..    }

.. Suppose there was a ``produceOutput()`` method that wrote to a ``PrintWriter``:

.. .. code-block:: java

..    public void testProcessSomeInput()
..    {
..        // run the method to get results
..        doIt.produceOutput(out());

..        // test that the result is what was expected
..        assertThat("what I expect").isEqualTo(out().getHistory());
..    }

.. Finally, you can even deal with both input and output at the same time:

.. .. code-block:: java

..    public void testProcessSomeInput()
..    {
..        setIn("some test input");

..        // run the method to get results
..        doIt.processSomeStuff(in(), out());

..        // test that the result is what was expected
..        assertThat("output I want").isEqualTo( out().getHistory()));
..    }

.. The ``TestCase`` base class provides similar methods for setting ``System.in``
.. or retrieving the history from ``System.out``. See the javadoc for
.. `TestCase <https://courses.cs.vt.edu/~cs1114/api/student/TestCase.html>`_
.. for more details.
