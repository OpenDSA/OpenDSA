Project 1: Movie Rater Database
-------------------------------

.. revealjs-slide::

* We specify the class name for the project (MovieRaterProj), an
  interface that you must implement (MovieRater), and the name of a
  class that implements MovieRater (MovieRaterDB).

* This lets us write reference test cases for grading that make calls
  to the interface.

  * Reference tests do not write to System.out, or check the contents
    of System.out.

* The project design is pretty simple, because all that you really
  need to add is the implementation for the Sparse Matrix.   


Sparse Matrices

* Here is where we talk about sparse matrices.
