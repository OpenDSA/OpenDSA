Midterm 2 Structure
-------------------

.. revealjs-slide::

* Online, Tuesday, November 11
* Accessible (for 75 minutes) from 8am to 10pm
* 125 points
* Format

  * Similar to Midterm 1
  * Some Multiple Choice, True/False, some writing explanations or
    workng out problems, etc. 

* Anything from Chapter 1-7 is fair to ask about, but focus is
  on chapters 8-10.


Topics (1)
----------

.. revealjs-slide::

* Chapter 8: Sorting

  * How each of the algorithms work
  * The Best/Avg/Worst cost for each
  * Key proofs:

    * Lower bound for Exchange Sorts;
    * Worst case analysis for Radix Sort O(n log n)
    * Lower bound for sorting

      
Topics (2)
----------

.. revealjs-slide::

* Chapter 8: Sorting (cont)

  * Insertion Sort
  * Bubble Sort
  * Selection Sort
  * Shellsort
  * Mergesort
  * Quicksort
  * Heapsort
  * Radix Sort


Topics (3)
----------

.. revealjs-slide::

* Chapter 9: File Processing

  * Disk vs RAM memory hierarchy and equipment cost vs. access time
  * Main parts of a disk access: Seek, rotational delay, actual read
  * External Sorting Algorithm

    * Replacement Selection
    * Multiway Merge


Topics (4)
----------

.. revealjs-slide::

* Chapter 10: Hashing
* Solves exact match queries exceptionally well
* What makes a hash function good or bad

  * Hash functions: Mod, Binning, mid-square, strings

* What makes a collision resolution good or bad

  * linear probing (possibly by steps)
  * pseudo-random probing
  * quadratic probing
  * double hashing

* How full the table ought to be (space vs. time)
* Expected cost analysis for hashing (when properly implemented)
