Project 4: Air Traffic Control
------------------------------

.. revealjs-slide::

* Similar to Project 2

* You will implement a simplified Air Traffic Control System

  * Store a bunch of objects in 3D
  * Objects are primarily represented by bounding boxes.
  * Two indices: A SkipList (replaces the BST) and a 3d BinTree
    (replaces the kd tree).


Design Issues
-------------

.. revealjs-slide::

* You will be storing a collection of objects that extend a base
  class.

  * Objects all have a name field (the key for the SkipList) and a 3D
    bounding box (used by the Bintree).

* The SkipList is a straightforward implementation (see code in
  OpenDSA).

  * This should be a generalized container class

* The Bintree is a full binary tree

  * Implement separate internal and leaf node classes that use an
    interface.

  * Implement empty nodes as a flyweight design pattern.

  * Implement the tree using the Composite design pattern.

Bintree 3
---------

.. revealjs-slide::

* You will be storing boxes, not points.

* Spatial data structures have a **Decomposition Rule**.

  * Our rule is that a node can store a list of up to three boxes, or
    as many boxes as required if they all share a common intersection.

  * If the boxes in the node violate this rule, then split it (during
    insertion).

  * If an internal node has two leaf children that, together, pass the
    rule, then merge them (on deletion).

* Since a box can appear in multiple nodes, collisions and
  intersections are only reported as associated with the origin point
  of the intersection box.
