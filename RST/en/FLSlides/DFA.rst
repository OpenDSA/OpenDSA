Deterministic Finite Acceptors
==============================

Deterministic Finite Acceptors
------------------------------

.. slide:: Introduction: Terminology

   | Finite State Machine
   | Finite State Automata
   | Finite Automata
   | Automata: This just means "machine"
   |   All names for a simple model of computation that has:
   |   * States that the machine can be in (nodes)
   |   * Input (string)
   |   * Transitions on a character between states (edges)
   |   * Some machine types have memory


.. slide:: Deterministic Finite Acceptor

   | Our simplest machine.
   |   Deterministic: In a state, when given a specific letter,
       only one thing to do.
   |   Finite: Finite number of states
   |   Acceptor: It only decides whether or not a string is in this
       machine's language (so it has no ability to modify the tape)

.. slide:: DFA: Formal Definition

   Define a DFA as :math:`(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)` where

   * :math:`Q` is a finite set of states
   * :math:`\Sigma` is the input alphabet (a finite set) 
   * :math:`\delta: Q \times\Sigma \rightarrow Q`.
     A set of transitions like :math:`(q_i, a) \rightarrow q_j`
     meaning that when in state :math:`q_i`, if you see letter :math:`a`,
     consume it and go to state :math:`q_j`.
   * :math:`q_0` is the initial state (:math:`q_0 \in Q`)
   * :math:`F \subseteq Q` is a set of final states


.. slide:: Concept: Accepting a String

   Example: A DFA that accepts even binary numbers.

      :scripts: DataStructures/FLA/FA.js AV/VisFormalLang/FA/EvenBinaryDFACON.js
      :align: center

   | Assign meaning to the states: q0 - odd numbers, q1 - even numbers, 
   | Note the triangle: Start State
   | Note the double circle: Final (Accepting) State

   We accept the string if we halt (finish the string) in a final
   state.


.. slide:: Formal Definition

   :math:`M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q0, F) =`

      \begin{array}{r|cc}
      & 0  & 1 \\
      \hline
      q0 &  &  \\
      q1 &  &  \\
      \end{array}

.. slide:: Concept: Power of DFAs
           
   | A given DFA can accept a set of strings: A language.
   | All of the possible DFAs form a class of machines.
   | So DFAs (as a class of machines) can accept certain languages
     (as a matching class of langauges).

.. slide:: Algorithm for DFA


   | Start in start state with input on tape
   | q = current state
   | s = current symbol on tape
   | while (s != blank) do
   |    :math:`q = \delta(q,s)`
   |    s = next symbol to the right on tape
   | if :math:`q \in F` then accept


.. slide:: Trace

   Example of a trace: 100

   .. inlineav:: OddNumbersTraceCON dgm
      :links: AV/VisFormalLang/FA/OddNumbersTraceCON.css
      :scripts: DataStructures/FLA/FA.js AV/VisFormalLang/FA/OddNumbersTraceCON.js
      :align: center


.. slide:: Definitions

   | :math:`\lambda` (lambda): The empty string
   | :math:`{\delta}^{*}(q,\lambda)=q`
   |   You didn't go anywhere, you are still in state :math:`q`
   | :math:`{\delta}^{*}(q_i,w)= q_j`
   |   Given string :math:`w` and
       starting in state :math:`q_i`, we will reach state :math:`q_j`.
   | :math:`{\delta}^{*}(q,wa)={\delta}({\delta}^{*}(q,w),a)`
   |   Apply :math:`\delta` to all of :math:`w` first (some string) and
       then to :math:`a`
   | The language accepted by a DFA
     :math:`M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)` is set of all strings on
     :math:`\Sigma` accepted by :math:`M`.
   |   Formally,
       :math:`L(M) = \{w\in{\Sigma}^{*}\mid {\delta}^{*}(q_0,w)\in F\}`
   | Set of strings not accepted:
       :math:`\overline{L(M)} = \{w\in{\Sigma}^{*}\mid {\delta}^{*}(q_0,w)\not\in F\}`


.. slide:: Incomplete DFA

   | Note that our DFA for even binary numbers is "complete".
   |   We always know what to do on any input.

   Consider the language :math:`L(M) = \{b^na | n > 0\}`

   .. inlineav:: DFA_noTrapStateCON dgm
      :links: DataStructures/FLA/FLA.css AV/VisFormalLang/FA/DFA_noTrapStateCON.css
      :scripts: DataStructures/FLA/FA.js AV/VisFormalLang/FA/DFA_noTrapStateCON.js
      :align: center

   This is technically incomplete. It shows all ways that we **can**
   reach an accepting state.


.. slide:: Trap State

   Can complete by adding one or more "trap" states with the
   "extra" transitions.

   .. inlineav:: DFA_withTrapStateCON dgm
      :links: DataStructures/FLA/FLA.css AV/VisFormalLang/FA/DFA_withTrapStateCON.css
      :scripts: DataStructures/FLA/FA.js AV/VisFormalLang/FA/DFA_withTrapStateCON.js
      :align: center

   | There is nothing "special" about a trap state, they are
     just conceptual.
   |   A "trap" state means that once in, all transitions keep us
       there.
   |   A "final" trap state is any trap state that is a final.
       Example: Define a machine that accepts any string that starts
       with "ab".


.. slide:: Regular Languages

   **Definition**: Given some class or type of Finite Acceptors,
   the set of languages accepted by that class of Finite Acceptors is
   called a **family**.
           
   **Definition**: Therefore, the DFAs define a **family** of
   languages that they accept.
   A language is **regular** if and only if
   there exists a DFA :math:`M` such that :math:`L = L(M)`.
