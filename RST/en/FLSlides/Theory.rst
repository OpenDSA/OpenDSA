Traditional Branches of Theory in CS
====================================

.. slide:: Three Traditional Branches of Theory in CS

   * Formal Languages and Automata
   * Computability
   * Complexity

     
.. slide:: Formal Languages and Automata
           
   | Studies the limits to computational systems like grammars and
     automata.
   |  Answers questions like these:
   |    What languages are represented/accepted by a grammar or
        machine?
   |    Are two representations equivalent (accept the same languages)?

       
.. slide:: Computablity

   | Studies the limits of computational systems from a different
     perspective from FLA
   | Answers questions like these:
   |   Can an artifact of this system solve a given problem?
   |   Can we answer questions about the capabilities of an artifact?
   |     Does it halt on given input?
   |     Do two artifacts do the same thing?

       
.. slide:: Complexity

   | The other two branches talk about "what is possible".
   | Complexity theory is all about performance.
   |   Reductions
   |   Classifies problems by their "complexity"
   |     Does P = NP?
