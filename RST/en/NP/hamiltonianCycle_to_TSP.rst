Reduction of Hamiltonian Cycle to Traveling Salesman
====================================================

Hamiltonian Cycle to Traveling Salesman
---------------------------------------

The following slideshow shows that an instance of HAMILTONIAN CYCLE
can be reduced to an equivalent instance of TSP in polynomial time.
