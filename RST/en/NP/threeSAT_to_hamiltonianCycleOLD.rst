Reduction of 3-SAT to Hamiltonian Cycle
=======================================

3-SAT to Hamiltonian Cycle
--------------------------

The following slideshow shows that an instance of the 3-CNF
Satisfiability (3-SAT) problem can be reduced to an instance of
Hamiltonian Cycle in polynomial time.
A trivial change in the construction will allow reduction from 3-SAT
to the Hamiltonian Path problem.

This reduction can help in providing an NP Completeness proof for 
the Hamiltonian Cycle problem.
