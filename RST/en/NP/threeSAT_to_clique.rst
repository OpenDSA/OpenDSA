   :description: Presents a reduction of an instance of the 3-Satisfiability problem to an instance of the Clique problem.

Reduction of 3-SAT to Clique
============================

Reduction of 3-SAT to Clique
----------------------------

The following slideshow shows that an input instance to the **3-SAT**
problem can be reduced to an equivalent input instance to the
**CLIQUE** problem in polynomial time.
