   :description: Presents a reduction of an instance of the Circuit Satisfiability problem to an instance of the (general) CNF Satisfiability problem.

Reduction of Circuit SAT to SAT
===============================

Reduction of Circuit SAT to SAT
-------------------------------

The following slideshow shows that an instance of the Circuit Satisfiability 
problem can be reduced to an equivalent instance of the SAT problem in
polynomial time.
