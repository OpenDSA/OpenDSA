Reduction of SAT to 3-SAT
=========================

Reduction of SAT to 3-SAT
-------------------------

The following slideshow shows that any general instance of the
Formula Satisfiability (**SAT**) problem can be reduced to an instance of 3 CNF
Satisfiability (**3-SAT**) problem in polynomial time.
