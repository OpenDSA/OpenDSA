   :description: Presents a reduction of an instance of the Independent Set problem to an instance of the Vertex Cover problem.

Reduction of Independent Set to Vertex Cover
============================================

Independent Set to Vertex Cover
-------------------------------

The following slideshow shows that an input instance to **INDEPENDENT SET**
can be reduced to an equivalent input instance to **VERTEX COVER**
in polynomial time.
