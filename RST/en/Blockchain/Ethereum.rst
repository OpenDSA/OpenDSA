Ethereum
========

The Problem to Solve
--------------------

Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency has a major problem.
It is based on Proof of Work as the heart of its consensus algorithm.
This has the unfortunate consequence of causing miners to waste a lot
of electricity simply to add blocks to a blockchain.
This is unnecesary... at least in theory.
The problem is that coming up with a reliable and secure consensus
algorithm for a public, distributed ledger is quite difficult.
Bitcoin was such a revolution for both blockchain technology and
cryptocurrency technology because it was the first proposed solution
to managing a secure public distributed ledger.
Finding alternatives to the Proof of Work consensus algoorithm has
proved to be difficult.

Introduction to Ethereum
------------------------

Ethereum is intended to use a consensus algorithm that is not based on
Proof of Work.
It has gone through significant evolution as the Ethereum community
figures out how to make this work.
