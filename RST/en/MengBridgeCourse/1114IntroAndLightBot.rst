Getting Started
===============


Introducing LightBot
--------------------

LightBot is a very simple robot programming simulation game. It runs right in
your web browser, and looks like this:

.. odsafig:: Images/LightBotLevel2.png
   :align: center

In the LightBot game, you create a **program** to control a little robot to
solve a simple task in the miniature block-based world where the LightBot exists.
The programming in LightBot is iconic. The icons at the top right of the game's
display represent instructions to the robot. Each icon instructs the robot to do
something--go one square forward, turn right, turn left, jump forward, and light
up the square the robot standing on. Of course the square will only light up if
the robot is on a blue square. The speaker icon in the upper left corner will
allow you to toggle the game sound on and off. The reset button in the lower
left corner will delete all of your instructions and start the level over.

Your task on each level of the LightBot game is to get the robot to light up
all of the blue squares. To create a program to control the robot simply drag
the icons at the top and drop them on the main method squares left to right.

   Be sure your browser window is tall enough to see the "Instructions" label
   in the upper right of the game.

The LightBot game illustrates several basic programming concepts. The robot
itself is an **object**, and we can request it to perform specific actions that
it knows how to carry out. We can write a series of these requests down as
a **program**. The series of actions that we write down is a plan for solving
a specific problem (an **algorithm**).


From LightBot to Micro Worlds
-----------------------------

The LightBot game is an example of a **micro-world**. A micro-world is a
miniature simulated environment that is populated with one or more objects
with clearly defined behaviors, and that can be visually represented so that
you can see how the objects move around and behave over time.

Micro-worlds typically use a **grid** to represent locations in the simulated
world. You can see this in the LightBot game, where the robot walks on square
tiles. In this course, we will use the same approach. We can refer to any
location on a grid using x and y coordinates:

.. odsafig:: Images/micro-world-coordinates.png
   :align: center

We will use a variation of **Cartesian coordinates** to write any location as
an *(x, y)* pair, where x (the first coordinate) represents the distance from
the origin horizontally, and y (the second coordinate) represents the distance
from the origin vertically. The only catch is that
the **y axis points downward** in our grid, making this
a *left-handed Cartesian plane*. We use a left-handed orientation for our axes
because that convention is predominant in computer programming contexts (even
though it is the opposite of what is typical in studying geometry!).

So the highlighted cell in the grid shown above is at location (4, 2), since
it is 4 cells horizontally to the right of the origin, and 2 cells vertically
down from the origin. Also notice that the origin (0, 0) is explicitly
represented in our grid and is located at the **top left corner**. The grid
above is 10 by 10 in size, where coordinates run from 0 up to and including
9. This means we will always used **zero-based indexing** when referring to
grid positions--i.e., we always start counting from zero at the origin (top
left), rather than starting with one.

A Bit More LightBot
-------------------

If you only played the first two levels of LightBot, there's definitely more
interesting stuff you haven't seen! As the levels progress, the puzzles get
more complicated. They are harder to solve using the limited number of slots
in the program memory for the little robot. Fortunately, the LightBot game
provides a few more icons for you to use.

The original version of LightBot provided two smaller instruction areas
: f1 and f2.
The f1 and f2 icons represent the two functions (icon areas) below the main
method in the LightBot game. These two functions are where you will place
instructions that the robot will need to perform multiple times. Anywhere
you place the f1 or f2 icon, the robot will perform the entire sequence of
actions associated with that function. This will allow you to build more
complex programs which are necessary to solve the more challenging tasks in
the later levels.

.. admonition:: Try It Yourself

    Return to the `LightBot game <https://www.lightbot.lu/>`_. Continue to play through
    Level 7. Once you have completed Level 7, stop. You'll return to finish
    Level 8 in the next exercise.



Textually Representing Programs
-------------------------------

Computer programs are most often written in textual form--in fact, one of the most important goals of programming is to write programs so that they communicate well to *other people*. So let's look at how we can represent LightBot puzzle solutions as text.

At its most basic, a computer program is simply a sequence of instructions for a computer to follow. Our LightBot level solutions are just that: programs. All we need in order to write them textually is names that correspond to the icons. For example, if we call our little robot :code:``andy``, we could use the following names to correspond to his icons (from left to right):

.. raw:: html

    <table class="docutils align-default" style="margin-bottom:1em;">
    <thead><tr><th>Symbol</th><th>Textual Program Statement (Method Call)</th></tr></thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr><td><img src="https://courses.cs.vt.edu/~cs1114/booklet//img/light-bot-move.png"/></td>
    <td><code>andy.move();</code></td></tr>
     <tr><td><img src="https://courses.cs.vt.edu/~cs1114/booklet//img/light-bot-right.png"/></td>
    <td><code>andy.turnRight();</code></td></tr>
    <tr><td><img src="https://courses.cs.vt.edu/~cs1114/booklet//img/light-bot-left.png"/></td>
    <td><code>andy.turnLeft();</code></td></tr>
    <tr><td><img src="https://courses.cs.vt.edu/~cs1114/booklet//img/light-bot-jump.png"/></td>
    <td><code>andy.jump();</code></td></tr>
    <tr><td><img src="https://courses.cs.vt.edu/~cs1114/booklet//img/light-bot-light.png"/></td>
    <td><code>andy.turnLightOn();</code></td></tr>
    <tr><td><img src="https://courses.cs.vt.edu/~cs1114/booklet//img/light-bot-f1.png"/></td>
    <td><code>andy.f1();</code></td></tr>
    <tr><td><img src="https://courses.cs.vt.edu/~cs1114/booklet//img/light-bot-f2.png"/></td>
    <td><code>andy.f2();</code></td></tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

Each action is phrased as a request to an object that performs the desired behavior. So each request goes to our robot, :code:``andy``. For example, consider Level 2:

.. odsafig:: Images/LightBotLevel2.png
   :align: center

One solution to this level is:

.. code-block:: java

    andy.move();
    andy.turnRight();
    andy.move();
    andy.turnLeft();
    andy.move();
    andy.move();
    andy.turnLeft();
    andy.move();
    andy.turnRight();
    andy.move();
    andy.turnLightOn();



.. admonition:: Try It Yourself

    Return to the `LightBot game <https://www.lightbot.lu/>`_. Complete Level 7
    if you have not already done so. Once you have completed Level 7, think
    carefully about your solution for Level 8. Compose your solution for
    Level 8 but don't run it yet. **Write down your solution for Level 8
    in textual form on scratch paper.**

    After writing down your solution, then run it. If it does not work the way
    you planned, revise it and revise your textual version, too before running
    it again. This will help you practice writing down program steps.

What Does LightBot Say About Programming?
-----------------------------------------

The LightBot game illustrates several basic programming concepts:


* Object

* Method

* Method Call

* State

* Algorithm

* Program

* Source Code

* Interpreter


In this course, we are going to focus on
learning **object-oriented programming** in Java. This section describes
several general concepts about object-oriented programs that we have seen
in this first example. As you read subsequent chapters, refer back to this
chapter to review the meaning of important words and phrases.


Programs and Programming Languages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It doesn't matter whether we are sending email, surfing the net,
to music, writing an essay, or playing a game, whenever we
a computer we are using one or more computer programs.  Each
is simply a set of instructions for the computer.

.. note::

    A computer **program** is a set of instructions for a computer.

Every program is written by one or more programmers.  Programmers
a programming language, such as Java, C++, Python, or Visual Basic
write a computer program.  For LightBot, you first used an
iconic language, and then learned how to use a simple textual language
represents exactly the same actions.

Programs exist in many forms.  The form that a programmer writes
called the source code for the program.  Unfortunately, a computer
use source code directly.  Source code must be translated
machine language before it can be executed (run) by the
computer.

.. note::

    The **source code** for a program
    is written by a programmer in some programming language.

There are several kinds of translation.  A compiler translates a
program, as a whole, from one form to another, but not necessarily
into machine language.  An interpreter translates a program into
machine language one statement at a time.  Each statement is executed
as soon as it has been translated.  LightBot is an example of an
interpreter, since it converts each source code action directly into
computer behavior, one statement at a time.

.. note::

    A **compiler** translates a program,
    as a whole, from one form to another.

    An **interpreter** translates a
    program into machine language one statement at a time.


Algorithms
~~~~~~~~~~

Every computer program starts with a plan.  That plan is called an
algorithm.  There are many ways to write an algorithm.  Some are very
informal, some are quite formal and mathematical in nature, and some
are quite graphical.  The form is not particularly important as long
as it provides a good way to describe and check the logic of the
plan.

.. note::

    An **algorithm** is a plan for solving a problem.


Objects
~~~~~~~

It should come as no surprise to learn that an object-oriented
programming language works with objects.  But what is an object?
Unfortunately, this concept is difficult to define because an object
is simultaneously something that only exists within a computer program
and a logical representation of something else.  A good approach is
to define an object in terms of what it represents.

.. note::

    An **object** represents a specific
    concept or item that is relevant to the problem we are trying to
    solve.

A typical program works with several different objects.  Some of
these may represent the same kind of thing.  For example, in LightBot
it seems obvious that the robot itself is an object.  But there are
also bricks that block the robot's path and that can be stacked.  There
are also blue squares that can be lighted.  There might be multiple
bricks, or multiple blue squares on a level, and these are all individual
objects, even though they are of the same kind.

An object represents something, but we, as programmers, need to
determine what characteristics of that thing are important to the
problem we are trying to solve.  There are two parts to an object,
facts about the thing it represents (Is the blue square lit yet, or
still dim? Which direction is the robot facing?), and tasks that the
object can perform (the robot can move, turn left or right, and so on).
The facts are called attributes (we'll cover those later) and the
tasks are called methods.


Methods and Behaviors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When we design an object, we need to determin what tasks it should
perform.  In doing so, we tend to anthropomorphize the item that the
object represents. (To anthropomorphize means to ascribe human
characteristics to non-human things.)  For example, we might want the
LightBot to move from one location to another, or jump up on an
obstacle.

.. note::

    A **behavior** is an action that an
    object can take or a task that it can perform in response to a
    request from an external source.

    A **method** is a collection of
    statements that are written in some programming language to describe
    a specific behavior.

    A **precondition** for a method is
    something that is assumed to be true before the method is invoked.

    A **postcondition** for a method is
    something that is assumed to be true after the method has been executed.

For example, our LightBot supports a number of methods that
correspond to the icons we can use, and which we gave textual names
in the previous section.  Also, some methods only work under certain
conditions: the robot can only jump (up or down) if the square
immediately in front of it is exactly one block higher or lower than
where the robot is standing.  This is a **precondition**.  Similarly,
the icon to light up the current square only works when the robot is
standing on a blue square (also a precondition).  However, if the robot
is indeed standing on a blue square, and then it executes its "turn light
on" behavior, then afterward the blue square will be lit
(a postcondition, which describes the outcome of executing a specific
behavior or method).


Messages (Invoking Methods)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When we write an object-oriented program, we instantiate appropriate
objects and ask them to perform specific tasks.  We use message to
make these requests.

.. note::

    A **message** is a request for a
    specific object to perform a specific task.

    When we ask an object to perform a task, we say that we are
    **sending a message** or **invoking the method** that
    describes the task.


A Programmable LightBot in Java
-------------------------------

The LightBot World Top-Down
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the sections above, you played with the
LightBot game, and even saw a textual representation for the graphical
commands that the little robot obeys.  Now it is time to turn those
concepts into a full-fledged program that you can write yourself.

First, recall that LightBot is really just a form of
**micro-world**: each "level" of
the game is a miniature world that can be represented as a grid, and
all of the objects--the robot, the blocks, the bue tiles that light
up--occupy different locations on this grid.  The flash game uses
isometric projection to make the world look more three-dimensional,
and animation to make it more attractive.  For example, here is the
second level of the LightBot game you saw in Chapter 1:

.. odsafig:: Images/LightBotLevel2.png
   :align: center

To simplify things somewhat, however, let's use a plain
top-down view of the same situation:

.. odsafig:: Images/light-bot-lev2g.png
   :align: center

In this top-down view, it is much easier to see which direction
is the *x* direction and which is the *y* direction,
so we can keep our coordinates straight.  Also, this picture highlights
the fact that each LightBot level is an 8 x 8 grid. As another example,
the third level of the LightBot game looks like this in the
original:

.. odsafig:: Images/light-bot-lev3.png
   :align: center

But the same level can be represented top-down like this:

.. odsafig:: Images/light-bot-lev3g.png
   :align: center

Now that we have our "world" figured out, we can talk about
writing source code to control the robot in it.


The Methods of a LightBot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's start our discussion of writing LightBot programs by
recapping the basic commands that every LightBot understands.
Earlier, we saw that LightBots know how to perform seven basic
actions or behaviors:

.. raw:: html

    <table class="docutils align-default" style="margin-bottom:1em;">
    <thead><tr><th>Method</th><th>What Happens</th></tr></thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr><td><code>move()</code></td>
    <td>The robot moves forward one square (if it can)</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>turnRight()</code></td>
    <td>The robot turns 90 degrees to its right (clockwise)</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>turnLeft()</code></td>
    <td>The robot turns 90 degrees to its left (counterclockwise)</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>jump()</code></td>
    <td>The robot moves forward by jumping up one block higher, or by jumping down one or more blocks lower (if it can)</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>turnLightOn()</code></td>
    <td>The robot lights up the blue tile, if it is standing on one</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>f1()</code></td>
    <td>The robot carries out whatever sequence of actions you have defined for the method <code>f1</code></td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>f2()</code></td>
    <td>The robot carries out whatever sequence of actions you have defined for the method <code>f1</code></td></tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

In an object-oriented program, we would model the LightBot,
its world (the level we are playing), the blocks in the world,
and the blue tiles as **objects**.
Each object provides a set of behaviors that it understands, and
these behaviors are implemented as **methods**.  So the seven behaviors
shown above that are understood by every LightBot are its methods.  When we
**call a method** (which is the
same thing as *invoke a method* or *send a message*),
we are requesting that an object carry out a specific method that
we identify by name.  Of course, to call a method, we have to
know exactly which object we want to carry out the action.


Where Do We Write It?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All of the program code we write must go somewhere.  But where do
we put it?  In an object-oriented program, all program statements
go inside a **method**, and every method belongs to an object (or to a
**class**, a family of objects that all understand the same methods).

The programming environment we will use in this course is called
**Eclipse**.  We are also using class libraries from
**Greenfoot**, a framework that allows us to work with many
kinds of micro-worlds.

When you open a project in Eclipse, you will see a list of the
various Java classes you are working on in the **Package Explorer** view on
the lefthand side. Here, we can see Eclipse's
main window looking at a simple Java project for solving LightBot
Level 3.

.. odsafig:: Images/eclipse-level3.png
   :align: center

You can double-click on any Java class in the project to open it
in the editor and view its program code. For our micro-world
assignments, you will also see a class with a name beginning with ``Run``,
which we will use to launch and run our programs (full instructions are
in the first lab assignment).

.. odsafig:: Images/lightbot3.png
   :align: center

When you run any micro-world program, you will see the world
displayed.
The main area of the display consists of a top-down view of
the world, in this case Level 3 of the LightBot game. You will
also see controls at the bottom to ``Act`` (cause objects to execute
their next action), ``Run`` (cause objects to repeatedly act over and
over), and control the speed of execution.

Each Java class that you write will have its source code stored
in a text file that has *the same name* as the class with a ".java"
extension. We call these "source files", because they contain the
Java "source code" defining your classes.
By double-clicking on a source file name in Eclipse's Package Explorer, you
can see (and edit) your class source code in an edit window.  If
you double-click on ``Level3Solution.java``, you will see its contents:

.. odsafig:: Images/eclipse-level3-editor.png
   :align: center

In the editor notice that a method has already been written
to hold new code.  This method is called ``myProgram()``,
and it represents the behavior that will be carried out when you
press the ``Run`` button at the bottom of your program's window.
This method has the following structure:

.. odsafig:: Images/method_structure0.png
   :align: center


Syntax Practice 1a
------------------

.. extrtoolembed:: 'Syntax Practice 1a'
   :workout_id: 1722


Creating New Objects
--------------------

In order to call methods on an object to solve a problem, first we
actually need an object!  That means that creating the objects we
need to solve a problem is part of our work in constructing a solution.

.. note::

    Creating a new object is called **instantiation**.

Sometimes, all we need to do is create and object, and that
act by itself does what we need.  But most of the time, we create an
object so we can ask it to do things--call its methods.  In order
to call methods on an object, we need some way to refer to the
object we are talking to.  In most cases, we do this by introducing
a *name* that refers to the object.  These names are called
**variables** (although we'll get more precise about that later).

.. note::

    A new name is introduced in a program in a **declaration**.

It is common for these two tasks--declaring a new name, and
creating a new object--to go together, and Java provides a convenient
way for us to express this two-part pattern:

.. odsafig:: Images/vardecl.png
   :align: center

The is the syntax for declaring a new name and creating a
new ``LightBot`` object. The declaration portion
indicates that the programmer plans to use a ``LightBot``
to help solve the problem at hand.  The programmer must provide an
identifier (or name) for the ``LightBot`` object.

.. note::

   * An **identifier** (or name) in Java should start with a letter, which may be followed by other letters or numeric digits.
   * We will use a **lowercase letter** as the first letter in an identifier when we are giving names to variables or methods.
   * We will use a **capital letter** as the first letter in an identifier when we are giving names to *classes* (a class is a family of objects that all understand the same methods, like ``LightBot``, which represents all the ``LightBot`` objects we can create--they all understand the same seven basic methods).
   * Java also allows underscores (_) and dollar signs ($) to be used in identifiers, but we will not use them in this course.

The **instantiation portion** of the figure above is
a request that the ``LightBot`` object be created.  The
crucial part of the instantiation is the
**constructor**, which is a special
method used only to create new objects.  The constructor in this
figure has the form ``LightBot()``.  It specifies the type
of object we want to create by giving the name of a class--here,
we are creating a new ``LightBot``--followed by a pair of
parentheses.  In Java, parentheses are always used following a name
when you are calling a method or calling a constructor.  Later, we'll
see how values can be provided inside the parentheses to customize
the object that is being constructed.

Suppose we wish to create a new ``LightBot`` and we want
to refer to it by the name ``andy`` (a good name for an
android).  Then we could declare the name ``andy`` and create
the ``LightBot`` with this statement:


.. code-block:: java

    LightBot andy = new LightBot();


We can place this inside our ``myProgram()`` method:


.. code-block:: java

    public void myProgram()
    {
        LightBot andy = new LightBot();

        // ... more goes here ...
    }


While this creates a new LightBot, we haven't said where to place
him in the world.  Suppose we want to add ``andy`` to
the world at location (0, 4).  We can do that using a method that all
world objects understand called ``add()``, like this:

.. code-block:: java

    public void myProgram()
    {
        LightBot andy = new LightBot();
        this.addObject(andy, 0, 4);

        // ... more goes here ...
    }

Now it is time to try out your first program!  You will find instructions
for running a program just like this in the first lab assignment.

OK, it isn't exciting, but you will see a new LightBot created
and added to the level at the coordinates you specified.  You can
use the "Reset" button at the bottom of the window to throw away
the current world and start with a brand new fresh copy, and you
can use "Run" to run your program again.  The "Act" button will
single-step your program, executing one action at a time sequentially
through ``myProgram()`` if you want to see what happens in
super-slow-mo.  Alternatively, use the speed slider to speed up or
slow down how fast the actions are carried out while your code is
running.


Calling Methods on an Object
----------------------------

OK, so we've created a ``LightBot``, but it doesn't
do very much.  How do we request it to carry out actions?
An action statement is a request that an object perform a specific
task.  That task can be either one of the basic action methods that
the object already knows, or it could be a new method that you wrote
yourself.  The syntax of an action statement is:

.. odsafig:: Images/actionstatement.png
   :align: center

An action statement is also called a
**method call** statement, since
it calls a method on an object.  The *identifier* to the left of
the dot identifies which object will receive the message--that is,
which object are we asking to perform the desired action.  The object
that is receiving the message (the object we are calling the method
on) is called the **receiver**.
The *methodName* indicates which method we are asking the
object to perform.  A method call in Java always includes a pair
of parentheses after the method name.  For methods that require
extra information to do their job, we place the extra information
between the parentheses (the *parameters* to the method).
None of our ``LightBot`` methods require any extra
information, so all of their parentheses will be
empty--\ **but the parentheses are still required**.

So if we want ``andy`` to move forward, we can write the
corresponding action statement like this:

.. code-block:: java

    andy.move();

This method call consists of three key parts: the *receiver*
to the left of the dot, the *method name* to the right of the
dot, and the *parentheses* after the method name.  In addition
to these three parts, notice the **semicolon** at the
end of the line.  Just like the declaration and instantiation statement
we used to introduce the name ``andy``, all statements in
Java end in a semicolon.  Don't leave it off--it tells the computer
where each statement ends.


Putting it All Together
-----------------------

We can add the method call we just wrote to ``myProgram()``
like this:

.. code-block:: java

    public void myProgram()
    {
        LightBot andy = new LightBot();
        this.addObject(andy, 0, 4);

        andy.move();

        // ... more goes here ...
    }


If you make this change, compile your code, and then run it, you
will see the robot be created and placed in its starting location, and
then move one square forward.  To complete our solution, ``andy``
needs to jump up on the wall, and then jump down:

.. code-block:: java

    public void myProgram()
    {
        LightBot andy = new LightBot();
        this.addObject(andy, 0, 4);

        andy.move();
        andy.jump();
        andy.jump();

        // ... more goes here ...
    }


Finish writing the rest of the instructions for ``andy``
so that he can light up all the blue tiles.


A Word on Making Code Easy to Read
----------------------------------

When programmers write source code, they must pay particular
attention to making it easy to read for other people.  Most programmers
work in groups, and other programmers need to pick up and work with
existing code that may have been written by others a while ago--weeks,
months, or even many years ago.  As a result, it is crucial that
source code be easy for other people to read.

One way we make our code easy to read is by choosing meaningful
names for all our identifiers.  For example, ``Level3``
represents the layout of Level 3 in the LightBot game, and
``Level3Solution`` represents a solution to that specific
level layout.  Similarly, the method names for the behaviors that
LightBots can perform are things like ``move()``,
``jump()``, ``turnLeft()``, and so on.  The names
are chosen to match the behaviors so that little or no explanation
is necessary.

Another important tool in making source code easy to read is
is **commenting**.

.. note::

    A **comment** is a textual
    note included in source code for the benefit of other (human)
    readers.  Coments have no effect on how the program is executed
    or how the computer behaves.


Some comments are critically important in source code because
they explain to other programmers *how to use* a method
or a class.  In many programming languages, including Java, there
are established conventions for writing these comments so that
documentation about how to use your code can be automatically
generated.  You'll see plenty such documentation later, but for
now let's get our toes wet with the basics.


.. code-block:: java

    // A pair of slashes side by side marks the beginning of a Java comment.
    // Everything after them, including the two slashes themselves, is a comment.

    // Sometimes, // is used to place a comment on the end of a line
    // that also contains something else.  But more commonly, we'll see
    // double-slash comments as single-line comments on a line by
    // themselves.

    /*
     * It is also possible to write a multi-line comment in Java by
     * starting it with a slash followed by an asterisk (/*).  Everything
     * from this marker onward, across as many lines as you want, makes up
     * a single comment.  The comment ends with a matching asterisk followed
     * by a slash, like this:
     */

    // Finally, in Java there are specially marked comments that appear
    // just before a name is declared, providing documentation about what
    // that name means and how it is used.  All the comments above are
    // plain old comments that mean nothing outside of the source file
    // where they are written.  The following comment describes the purpose
    // of a method, however, and can be used to generate documentation for
    // it:

    /**
     * This comment describes the purpose of this method.  It is called a
     * Javadoc comment.  You can tell it is different from other comments
     * because it starts with "/**", instead of just "/*".  You should
     * include this kind of comment just before each method you write, and
     * just before each class you write.  It should describe the meaning/purpose
     * of what immediately follows--here, the method called doSomething().
     * The Javadoc comment should also explain how to use the method or
     * class it describes.
     */
    public void doSomething()
    {
        // ...
    }


For now, remember that you must include a Javadoc comment
(that is, a description) for each method you write and for each
class you write.  We'll try to make this easier for you as we
start, but it is a habit you'll have to become accustomed to
(and that will serve you well!).

A third important tool for making code easy for others to read
is **indentation**.  Programmers
use white space at the beginning of lines to show structure in
their source code.  You may have noticed that each of the methods
shown in this Chapter starts with an opening brace ({), also called
a left brace, a curly brace, a curly bracket, or just a curly.  Each
method also ends with a corresponding closing brace (}).  Statements
between these braces are *inside* the method--they are the
statements that define what behavior occurs when the method is called.
Because they are *inside* the braces (that is, *inside*
the method body), we put extra spaces at the beginning of each line
to show this nesting.

In this class, we will use all space characters to indent our code.
We will indent lines that are "contained within" a larger structure
by four spaces.  You'll see that the editor automatically tries to
help you keep this indentation habit as you write code, but it won't
force you.  Ultimately, you are responsible for making your code
look clean, neat, and readable.
