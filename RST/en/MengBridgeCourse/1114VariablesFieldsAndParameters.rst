Variables
---------

One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the ability to
define and manipulate variables. A **variable** is a named location that stores
a value. Values may be numbers, text, images, sounds, and other types of
data. To store a value, you first have to declare a variable.

.. code-block:: java

   int x = 7;

Each variable has a type that determines what kind of values it can store.
This statement is a **declaration**, because it declares that the variable
named ``x`` that is of type ``int``, and gives it an initial value of 7.

Note that ``x`` is an arbitrary name for the variable. In general, you should
use names that indicate what a variable represents--either the value it
holds, or the role it plays. For example, if you saw these
declarations, you could probably guess what values would be stored:

.. code-block:: java

   int ageInYears = 21;
   int studentID = 1234;

This example declares two variables, each of type int. When a variable name
contains more than one word, like ``ageInYears``, it is conventional to
capitalize the first letter of each word except the first, just like we do with
methods. This capitalization convention is called *camel case* (sometimes
written *CamelCase*), where the capital letters form periodic "humps" in the
height of the name. In Java, like the majority of programming languages,
names are case-sensitive, so ``ageInYears`` is not the same as
``ageinyears`` or ``AgeInYears``. Remember that variable names always start
with a lowercase letter, while initial capitals are reserved for class names
and interface names.

You can use any name you want for a variable. But there are about 50 reserved
words, called keywords, that you are not allowed to use as variable names.
These words include ``public``, ``class``, ``static``, ``void``, and ``int``,
which are used by the compiler to analyze the structure of the program.
You can find the `complete list of keywords <http://docs.oracle.com/
javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/_keywords.html>`_ online, but you don’t
have to memorize them. Most programming editors provide “syntax highlighting”,
which makes different parts of the program appear in different colors.


Variable Assignment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that we have declared variables, we want to use them to store values. We
do that with an assignment statement

.. code-block:: java

   int ageInYears = 29; // 29 is the initial value for ageInYears
   ageInYears = 21;  // set ageInYears to now store 21

This example shows a variable declaration followed by an
assignment statement. In Java, all local variables must be given an
initial value, and we use the same "=" character to show the value
stored in the variable as part of its declaration. However, after
we declare a variable, we can *change* its value any time we need to,
and we do that using an **assignment statement**. Here, we write the
variable by itself, followed by an equal sign (``=``), followed by
the new variable we want the variable to store. An assignment statement
*changes the value stored in the variable*, so that the next time we
use the variable, the corresponding value will be the new one. Remember
that the name "variable" reflects that fact that its value can *change (or
vary) over time* as your program runs, and assignment is how you change
that value.

Programmers may use phrases like "*set* ``ageInYears`` to 21", or
"*assign* 21 to ``ageInYears``", or even "*change* ``ageInYears`` to 21".
The vocabulary
can be confusing here, but the idea is straightforward:

* When you declare a variable, you create a named storage location and
  give it an initial value.

* When you assign to a variable, you update its value, replacing whatever
  value it previously held.

As a general rule, a variable has to have the same type as the value you
assign to it. For example, you cannot store a string in ``ageInYears``, since
it can only hold an integer. We will see some examples that seem to break this
rule, but we’ll get to that later.

Variables must always be initialized (assigned for the first time) when they
are declared, which you write on the same line:

.. code-block:: java

   int ageInYears = 29;


A Note About the = Sign
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lets take a look at the following code example:

.. code-block:: java

   int a = 5;
   int b = 7;
   a = b;

Because Java uses the ``=`` symbol for assignment, it is tempting to interpret
the assignment statement ``a = b`` as a statement of equality. It is not!

Equality is commutative, and assignment is not. For example, in mathematics
if ``a = 7`` then ``7 = a``. In Java ``a = 7;`` is a legal assignment
statement, but ``7 = a;`` is not. This is because an assignment statement **is
an action** that changes the variable on the left by setting its value to
be the value appearing on the right of the ``=`` sign.
As a result, the left side of an assignment statement
has to be a storage location such as a variable.

Also, in mathematics, a statement of equality is true for all time. If a = b
now, a is always equal to b. In Java, an assignment statement can make two
variables equal, but they don’t have to stay that way:

.. code-block:: java

   int a = 5;
   int b = a; //a and b are now equal
   a = 3;     //a and b are no longer equal!

The first line declares variable ``a`` and initializes it with the value 5.
The second line declares variable ``b`` and initializes it with the value of
``a``, which at that point is 5.
The third line changes the value of ``a`` to 3, but it does not change the
value of ``b``, so they are no longer equal.  ``a`` now has a value of 3,
while ``b`` has a value of 5.

   </div>


Arithmetic Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Operators are symbols that represent simple computations. For example, the
addition operator is ``+``, subtraction is ``-``, multiplication is ``*``,
and division is ``/``.

The following program converts a time of day to minutes:

.. code-block:: java

   int hour = 11;
   int minutes = 59;
   int timeAsMinutes = hour * 60 + minutes;

In this program, ``hour * 60 + minutes`` is an **expression** that represents
a single value to be computed.
The operators are ``*`` and ``+``, which represent multiplication and division.
The operators work with are called
**operands** (which is a fancy name for parameters).  When the program runs,
each variable is replaced
by its current value, and then the operators are applied.

So even though you write ``hour * 60 + minutes``, java will compute that as
``11 * 60 + 59`` and assign ``timeAsMinutes`` the value 719. Expressions are
generally a combination of numbers, variables, and operators. When compiled
and executed, they are evaluated to produce a single value.  It is also
important to note that order of operations applies in Java just as it does in
math. ``11 * 60`` will get computed before ``59`` gets added, since
multiplication has higher precedence than addition.

While addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division(/) are
all mathematical operators you can use in programming, Java supports two more
unary operators you may not have seen.  These are ``++`` and ``--``.  These
add or subtract one, and are often used to incrementally increase or decrease
the value stored in a variable as part of a calculation.


A Note About Ints and Division
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Addition, subtraction, and multiplication all do what you expect, but you
might be surprised by division. For example, the following fragment tries to
compute the fraction of an hour that has elapsed:

.. code-block:: java

   int minutes = 59;
   int fractionOfHour = minutes / 60;

``fractionOfHour`` will actually be assigned the value 0 in this situation!
This result often confuses people. The value of ``minutes``` is 59, and 59
divided by 60 should be 0.98333, not 0. Java performs “integer
division” when the operands are integers, as in this case. By design, integer
division always rounds toward zero, even in cases like this one where the next
integer is close. Further, ``fractionOfHour``
is declared to be an ``int`` variable, so it can *only* hold an integer
value anyway, not a decimal fraction.

As an alternative, we can calculate a percentage rather than a fraction:

.. code-block:: java

   int minute = 59;
   int fractionOfHour = (minute * 100) / 60;

Now, ``fractionOfHour`` is assigned to 98.  Again the result is rounded down,
but at least now it’s approximately correct.

   <div class="align-center" style="margin-top:1em;">
   <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/46Ngr6eczpA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
   </div>



A New Type: Double
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While the examples above all make use of the data type ``int``, we can use
variables to store more than just integer values.

A more general solution for creating an accurate ``fractionOfHour`` variable is
to use a different type of data called a **double** (short for double-precision)
which can represent fractions as well as integers. A **double** value is
actually a digital approximation of a *real number* in the mathematical sense.
You can create ``double``
variables and assign values to them using the same syntax we used for the other
types:

.. code-block:: java

   double pi = 3.14159;

Java performs “floating-point division” when one or more operands are double
values. So we can solve the problem we saw in the previous section:

.. code-block:: java

   double minutes = 59.0;
   double fractionOfHour = minutes / 60;

Now, ``fractionOfHour`` is set to the value 0.9833333333333333.

Although floating-point numbers are useful, they can be a source of confusion.
For example, Java distinguishes the integer value 1 from the floating-point
value 1.0, even though they seem to be the same number. They belong to
different data types, and strictly speaking, you are not allowed to make
assignments between types.

The following is illegal because the variable being declared is an ``int`` and
the initial value on the right is a ``double``:

.. code-block:: java

   int x = 1.1; // compiler error

It is easy to forget this rule because in many cases Java automatically converts
from one type to another:

.. code-block:: java

   double y = 1; // legal, but bad style

The above example should be illegal, but Java allows it by automatically
converting the ``int`` value 1 to the ``double`` value 1.0 automatically. This
leniency is convenient, but it often causes problems for beginners.
For example:

.. code-block:: java

   double y = 1 / 3; // common mistake

You might expect the variable y to get the value 0.333333, which is a legal
value for a double.  But instead it gets the value 0.0. The expression on the
right divides two integers, so Java does integer division, which yields the
``int`` value 0. This ``int`` value is then implicitly converted to ``double``
so it can be used as the initial value of ``y``, so the value assigned to ``y``
is 0.0.


Using Booleans as Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When working with conditions in the previous two modules, you may remember
hearing a lot about the boolean values.
Just like ``int`` and ``double``, ``boolean`` is another data type Java
provides. Unlike ``int``\ s or ``double``\ s, a
``boolean`` value can only be ``true`` or ``false``.

We use these when working with while loops or if statements like this:

.. code-block:: java

   if (this.hasFlower())
   {
       this.hop();
   }

In this code, if the jeroo has a flower, it will hop.  ``hasFlower()`` is a
method that will return ``true`` or ``false`` depending on if the jeroo has a
flower.

We could store that boolean value in a variable if we wanted like this:

.. code-block:: java

   boolean pocketIsFull = this.hasFlower();

Here we've declared a boolean variable, named it ``pocketIsFull`` and set it
equal to the result returned by the ``hasFlower()`` method.

If we wanted to, we could then use that variable in our conditional:

.. code-block:: java

   boolean pocketIsFull = this.hasFlower();
   if (pocketIsFull)
   {
       this.hop();
   }

This is another way to write the same if statement!

Additionally, we can assign a ``boolean`` variable to the result of a compound
conditional:

.. code-block:: java

   boolean shouldToss = this.hasFlower() && this.seesNet(AHEAD);
   if (shouldToss)
   {
       this.toss();
   }

Remember above we declared and initialized an ``int`` variable that was the
result of a mathmatical expression.  The same thing will happen here.  Java
will evaluate ``this.hasFlower() && this.seesNet(AHEAD)``, and that compound
expression will produce a value that is either ``true`` or ``false``, then
this value will be used as the initial value of the variable ``shouldToss``.

Finally, if you just need a ``boolean`` value, you can initialize a ``boolean``
variable using the keywords ``true`` or ``false``.

.. code-block:: java

   boolean x = true;
   boolean y = false;


The Scope of a Local Variable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Local variables can be very useful tools. You should use a local variable
**whenever you need to refer to the same value more than once**, since a
local variable allows you to give a name to a value, so you can use that
name in more than one place. If you only need a value one time, a name
may not serve much of a purpose.

However, local variables are used for *local* names that are being used
within a single method (or even just a few statements within a method).
Programming languages use the term **scope** to refer to the region of
the program text where a name can be used. For local variables, each variable
declaration appears inside some pair of braces (``{ }``), such as the pair
of braces surrounding the body of a method. This pair of braces forms the
start and end of a block of program statements. The scope of that local variable
is all of the statements between its declaration and the closing brace (``}``)
at the end of the block of statements containing the declaration. The name
will not be recognized outside that block. Most importantly, this means
the variable declaration is not visible (can't be used) in other methods.

.. code-block:: java

   public void doSomeStuff()
   {
       int x = 17;  // declared here
       ...
       if (jeroo.getX() == 17)    // OK to use here, inside scope
       {
           ...
       }

       // scope of x ends at closing brace
   }

   public void doOtherStuff()
   {
      if (x == 17)  // compiler error! x can't be referenced
      {
          ...
      }
   }

In the code shown above, the local variable ``x`` is declared at the start of
method ``doSomeStuff()``, so that variable can be used anywhere inside that
method. However, the scope of ``x`` ends at the end of ``doSomeStuff()``, at
the closing brace that marks the end of the method.

That is why **local variables** are called **local**: they can only be used
in a small, localized region of your program text, only up until the next
closing brace. As a further example:

.. code-block:: java

   public void doSomeStuff()
   {
       ...
       if (jeroo.hasFlower())
       {
           int x = 17;  // declared here
           ...
           if (jeroo.getX() == 17)    // OK to use here, inside scope
           {
               ...
           }

           // scope of x ends at closing brace
       }

       x = 4;  // compiler error! x can't be referenced
   }

Local variables can be declared inside any pair of braces demarking a
series of statements. However, they are always *local* to that block of
statements, and can't be used outside that block. Here, ``x`` is declared
inside the true branch of the first if statement, so ``x`` is local to that
block of statements, and cannot be used outside the pair of braces where it
is declared.

Variables are not visible, and cannot be used, outside of their scope. Their
scope is the region of text where they are visible. In Java, scopes are
typically marked by pairs of braces (``{ }``).


Check Your Understanding: Variables
-----------------------------------

   :long_name: Variables


Fields Versus Local Variables
-----------------------------

Writing an object-oriented program is largely a matter of designing classes and
writing definitions for those classes in Java. Designing a class is a matter of
specifying all of the attributes and behaviors that are characteristic of that
type of object.

Up to this point we have been using the terms attribute and action to describe
an object’s features. However, when talking about a programming language,
the more common way to describe an object’s features are to talk about its
fields and methods.  **Fields** are a type of variable we define at the
beginning of a class that help us describe the qualities of a class.

For example, suppose we are writing a drawing program. One type of object we
would need for our program is a rectangle. A ``Rectangle`` object has two
key attributes: its length and its width. Inside the class, we can declare
two fields to store the values of these attributes: a ``length`` and
a ``width``.  Given these fields, we can
define characteristic rectangle actions, such as the ability to calculate its
area and the ability to draw itself. Identifying an object’s fields and
actions is the kind of design activity that goes into developing an
object-oriented program.

We can declare fields in our ``Rectangle`` class:

.. code-block:: java

   public class Rectangle
   {
       private int length;
       private int width;
       private int xCoord;
       private int yCoord;

       // other parts of the class go here ...
   }


Our rectangle has four attributes.
The first two, ``length`` and ``width``, store a
rectangle’s dimensions.
The second two, ``xCoord`` and ``yCoord``, store
a rectangle’s position when we draw it, much like how we determine a jeroo's
position on an island. Note that none of the attributes have values. This is
because the class represents a general type of rectangle, and each individual
rectangle will have its own values for these attributes. The
declaration specifies what all rectangles have in common, without representing any
particular rectangle. Like a
cookie cutter for a cookie, a class gives the general shape of an object. The
specific values for any individual object are not included.

Notably, these fields also use the keyword ``private`` meaning they can only be
accessed and manipulated inside this class.
By convention, we **always** include the keyword ``private`` to ensure that
only the code inside the class can access or change the fields. This
enforces a software engineering design principle called **information hiding**,
where only the class itself manages the information it is responsible for,
and no other code outside the class can interfere with or change this
internal information.

A field will have different values for different objects--that is, different
instances of the class.  For example, individual ``Rectangle``\ s will have
different values for their ``length``, ``width``, ``xCoord``, and ``yCoord``
fields.  For example, here are two different ``Rectangle`` objects we could make:

.. odsafig:: Images/RectangleObjects.png
   :align: center

To create two different ``Rectangle`` objects like this, we'll need a
constructor. Recall that one of the main responsibilities of a constructor
is to initialize the data stored in an object (i.e., stored in its fields).
Because our ``Rectangle`` class uses fields to store attribute values,
the constructor needs to initialize those values. Sometimes, you might
initialize a field to a fixed value for all objects, but often, you would
like for the code creating the object to specify the initial values. If
we want to do that here, we need a ``Rectangle`` constructor
that takes in 4 integers as parameters:

.. code-block:: java

   public class Rectangle
   {
       private int length;
       private int width;
       private int xCoord;
       private int yCoord;

       public Rectangle(int myLength, int myWidth, int initialX, int initialY)
       {
           this.length = myLength;
           this.width = myWidth;
           this.xCoord = initialX;
           this.yCoord = initialY;
       }

       // other parts of the class go here ...
   }

Then, if we wanted to call this constructor we could say:

.. code-block:: java

  Rectangle rectangle1 = new Rectangle(2, 5, 0, 0);

Which would set the ``length`` to 2, ``width`` to 5, and coordinates to (0, 0).


Changing Private Variables: Mutator Methods
-------------------------------------------

Recall that the fields of ``Rectangle`` are private.  We can access them
anywhere inside the ``Rectangle`` class, but not outside.

.. code-block:: java

   public class Runner
   {
       public void myProgram()
       {
           Rectangle rectangle1 = new Rectangle(0, 0, 2, 5);
           int w = rectangle1.width;  // compiler error! Can't access field
       }
   }


Because ``length`` is private, the code above will cause an error when
compiled.  This is a convenient way to prevent fields from being changed
accidentally or when you don't want them to, and amounts to enforced
information hiding. Information hiding helps limit the possibilities for
accidentally introducing bugs, and helps limit the search for them when they
do occur.  Additionally if our ``Rectangle`` class ever changed, it's likely the
code above would need to change too, making this ``Runner`` class *dependent*
on the internal details of the ``Rectangle`` class. That makes future changes
more work. So information hiding *reduces the opportunities for bugs*, and also
*reduces the amount of code we need to check when searching for bugs*, and
*reduces the cost of future changes*. That is why we will always declare
our fields to be ``private`` in this class. Eventually, you'll learn more about
other options for fields, but remember that relaxing information hiding comes
at a significant cost.

On the other hand, it's possible this ``Runner`` class would need to access
and maybe change fields in the ``Rectangle`` class--for example, to move it
to a new position.  Rather than allowing direct access to the fields, one
convention of object-oriented programming is to provide public methods to set
and get the values of some of the object's attributes when that is appropriate
for the design of the class.

Methods that get or retrieve the value of an attribute are called **accessor methods** or, more
colloquially, **getter** methods.
Methods that set an object’s attribute(s) to a new value are called
**mutator methods** or, more colloquially, **setter** methods.
Usually, accessor and mutator methods work
directly with the object's fields, if attributes are stored directly in fields.

It is up to the designer of the class to determine based on the abstraction
the class represents which attributes require accessor and/or mutator methods.
Some fields may be purely for internal use, and may not represent externally
visible attributes. Other attributes may be stored in fields, but might be
more suited to read-only use, where only accessor methods are provided. In
other cases, the class may support both reading and changing attributes, and
both an accessor and a mutator are a good fit.

If you were designing a ``BankAccount`` class, for example, you might want a
public ``getAccountNumber()`` method, so that clients could retrieve
information about their bank accounts, but you would probably not want a
public ``setAccountNumber()`` to let clients change that information, or
a public ``getAccountPassword()`` for data that should be kept internal-only.

We will discuss accessor methods below, but first let's look at mutator
methods.
For our ``Rectangle`` example, lets say we wanted to let other classes change
the ``xCoord`` and ``yCoord`` attributes to move the ``Rectangle`` around the
screen.  Mutator methods can be as simple as this:

.. code-block:: java

   public class Rectangle
   {
       // field declarations from above go here

       public void setXCoord(int newValue)
       {
           this.xCoord = newValue;
       }

       public void setYCoord(int newValue)
       {
           this.yCoord = newValue;
       }
   }

This code also shows the simple pattern for providing a mutator method for
any attribute that is stored directly in a field. The key elements of
this pattern are:

* The mutator method is ``public`` because we want it to be accessible anywhere.
* Its return type is ``void`` because this method does not ``return`` anything.
* This method is named by adding ``set`` as a prefix onto the name of
  the attribute that it changes, using our capitalization conventions for
  compound names.
* This method takes one parameter of the same type as the field.
* The body of the method uses an assignment statement to set the field to
  the new value.

This pattern is used so frequently, it is almost always what programmers
mean when they use the term "setter method", or say "add a setter method for
it".


A Note on Scope
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The bodies of the mutator methods make use of both fields and parameters. It is
important to note that there is a difference in where these two types of
variables can be used.  Remember the **scope** of a name or method refers
to where it can be used in a program.

A parameter’s scope is the body of the method in which it is declared.

For example consider the ``setLength()`` method below:

.. code-block:: java

   public class Rectangle
   {
       private int length;

       public void setLength(int len)
       {
           this.length = len;
       }
   }

In this code, the parameter name ``len``` cannot be referenced outside of the
``setLength()`` method.  It is completely invisible outside of the
braces (``{ }``) that surround the method's body.

Fields, on the other hand, are declared inside the braces (``{ }``) surrounding
the whole class, and so their scope is the entire class--they can be used
anywhere in the class, inside any method.
The field ``length``, for example, was declared outside of the ``setLength()``
method and can be accessed anywhere within the class.

Remember that local variables that are declared inside the body of a method
have a scope that extends from the point where they are declared to the end
of the block of code in which they are declared.

In summary:

* Fields are declared inside the class, so their scope is the entire class.
  They can be referenced inside any method in the class.
* Parameters are declared in the parameter list of a method declaration, so
  their scope is that entire method. They can be referenced anywhere inside
  the body of that method, but cannot be accessed outside the method where
  they are declared.
* Local variables are declared in a block of statements surrounded by
  braces (``{ }``). They can be accessed anywhere inside that block of code,
  from where the declaration is placed, up to the closing brace (``}``) marking
  the end of that block of code.

Accessor Methods
----------------

Creating an accessor method also follows a very simple pattern when the
corresponding attribute is stored in a field, although there is one twist we
have not covered before.

.. code-block:: java

   public class Rectangle
   {
       private int length;
       // other field declarations from above go here

       public int getLength()
       {
           return this.length;
       }
   }

This code shows the simple pattern for providing an accessor method for
any attribute that is stored directly in a field. The key elements of
this pattern are:

* The accessor method is ``public`` because we want it to be accessible anywhere.
* After the keyword ``public``, instead of ``void`` we list the type
  of data stored in the field, which is the same type of data this method will
  return.
* This method is named by adding ``get`` as a prefix onto the name of
  the attribute that it accesses, using our capitalization conventions for
  compound names.
* This method takes no parameters.
* The body of the method uses a ``return`` statement to return the value
  of the field.

This pattern is used so frequently, it is almost always what programmers
mean when they use the term "getter method", or say "add a getter method for
it".

What is different is the return type instead of ``void`` and this new ``return``
keyword, which we'll talk about in the next section.  For now, it's mostly
important to note that the return type of the method **must** match the type
of the field.  Thus, because ``length`` is defined as an ``int``, this getter
method must also have ``int`` as its return type.

----------------------------------------

The Return Keyword
------------------

Outside of methods with a return type of ``void``, all other methods you will
write in Java will specify a return type--the type of *answer* or *result*
the method will return. So far, we have primarily used ``void`` methods, which
do not return any result--in fact, ``void`` means "nothing", and we call those
methods for the actions they perform rather than any value they compute.

Methods that compute values for us "return" those values when they are called.
When we say "return a value", we mean "give us an answer" or "produce a result".
Compared to ``void`` methods, methods that return values differ in two ways:

* They declare the type of the return value (the **return type**).
* They use at least one ``return`` statement to provide a *return value**.

For example if you were to write the method:

.. code-block:: java

   public boolean isRaining()
   {
       // no code yet
   }

You would see a syntax error when compiling saying "missing return statement".
That is because the use of ``boolean`` after the keyword ``public``
specifies that this method *will* return a ``boolean`` result, but the
method body doesn't say what value is produced.
To fix this issue, we need to return something.


.. code-block:: java

   public boolean isRaining()
   {
       return false;
   }

The ``return`` statement is how we specify what value is produced by the
method when the method is called. After the keyword ``return``, you can use
any expression you want, including constants (like ``false`` above),
variables, fields, mathematical expressions, or even combinations of
other method calls.

The type of the expression in the ``return`` statement must match the return
type declared for the method. When you declare that the return type
is ``double``, you are making a promise that this method will eventually
produce a ``double`` value. If you try to ``return`` with no expression, or
an expression with the wrong type, the compiler will generate an error.


Doubling Back to Accessor Methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Writing an accessor method for a field *needs* to have a return type because
all fields have a type.

.. code-block:: java

   public class Rectangle
   {
       private int length;

       public Rectangle()
       {
           this.length = 4;
       }

       public int getLength()
       {
           return this.length;
       }
   }

In this situation our ``length`` field is of type ``int``, therefore our
accessor method for that field needs to also return an ``int``.


Writing More Complex Methods with Return
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes you may feel the need to write multiple return statements, for
example, one in each branch of a conditional:

.. code-block:: java

   public double absoluteValue(double x)
   {
       if (x < 0)
       {
           return -x;
       }
       else
       {
           return x;
       }
   }

Since these return statements are in a conditional statement, only one will be
executed. As soon as either of them executes, the **method terminates** without
executing any more statements. Of course, this means that other parts of
the method will not be executed after the ``return`` statement is reached.
Further, since a method that returns a value must **always** use a return
statement, no matter how the method ends, that is why you must include a
return statement in each and every branch, not just the first one.

Because of these constraints, some beginners find it easier always to
write a *single* return statement and place it as the very last statement
in the method--this ensures the method always returns a value, and never
accidentally skips any important steps. As you develop your skills, you may
find using multiple return statements easier in some situations, but always
remember they require more care and are subject to more possibilities for
mistakes, so fall back on using a single return statement when you have
trouble:

.. code-block:: java

   public double absoluteValue(double x)
   {
       double answer = x;
       if (x < 0)
       {
           answer = -x;
       }
       return answer;
   }

Here’s an example: ``calculateArea`` takes a double as a parameter and returns
the area of a circle with that radius:

.. code-block:: java

   public double calculateArea(double radius)
   {
      // Note that Math.PI is a constant with the value of pi
      double result = Math.PI * radius * radius;
      return result;
   }

This last line is a return statement.  This statement means, "exit immediately
from this method and use the following expression as the return value." Also,
note the use of the constant ``PI`` from the built-in Java utility class
called ``Math``. The Java ``Math`` class provides many useful and common
math functions, as well as definitions for the constants ``PI`` and ``E``.
In Java, by convention, programmers give constants names that are written
in all capitals, so you can easily distinguish them from variables or fields.

The expression you provide in a ``return`` statement can be arbitrarily
complex, so we could have written this method more concisely:

.. code-block:: java

   public double calculateArea(double radius)
   {
      return Math.PI * radius * radius;
   }

Code that appears after a return statement (in the same block), or any place
else where it can never be executed, is called **dead code**. The compiler will
give you an "unreachable statement" error if part of your code is dead. For
example, this method contains dead code:


.. code-block:: java

   public double absoluteValue(double x)
   {
      if (x < 0)
      {
         return -x;
      }
      else
      {
         return x;
      }
      x = 5;    // can never be executed
    }

That last line, ``x = 5`` would never run as a value would always be returned
from the method (ending the method) before that line could be reached.

If you put return statements inside a conditional statement, you have to
make sure that every possible path through the program reaches a return
statement. The compiler will let you know if that’s not the case. For
example, the following method is incomplete:

.. code-block:: java

   public double absoluteValue(double x)
   {
      if (x < 0)
      {
         return -x;
      }
      else if (x > 0)
      {
         return x;
      }
      // syntax error
   }

When x is 0, neither condition is true, so the method ends without hitting
a return statement. The error message in this case might be something like
“missing return statement”, which is confusing since there are already two of
them. But hopefully you will know what it means.

Again, if you run into difficulties, often an easy answer is to change the
structure of the method so that there is only a single ``return`` statement
at the very end of the method.


Using the Results of a Method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you invoke a void method, the invocation is usually on a line all by
itself. For example here is a simple hop and pick method for Jeroos.

.. code-block:: java

   public void hopAndPick()
   {
       this.hop();
       this.pick();
   }

And here is how it is called:

.. code-block:: java

   this.hopAndPick();

On the other hand, when you invoke a method with a return type, you have to
do something with the return value. We usually assign it to a variable or
use it as part of an expression.

Take for example this method:

.. code-block:: java

   public int square(int x)
   {
       return x * x;
   }

This method would take in some number ``x``, and return the value of that
number raised to the power of 2.

We could then call the method *and* instantiate a new variable to save the
result:

.. code-block:: java

   int base = 3;
   int raised = square(base);

In this situation, ``raised`` is set to the value 9 (the result of
computing 3 * 3).

Additionally, we can use the result of a method as a parameter for another
method call:

.. code-block:: java

   int base = 3;
   int raisedAgain = square(square(base));

This new variable ``raisedAgain`` will be set equal to 81. The calls to
``square()`` are evaluated "inside out", with the one inside parentheses
performed first. So ``base`` is passed as the argument to ``square()`` in
the first call, which returns 9. The return value 9 of the first call is
used as the parameter value in a second call to ``square()``, which then
returns 9 * 9 = 81.

This might remind you of working with functions in algebra classes.  In those
classes, we might see this same idea written out as:

Assume
f(x) = x * x
What is the value of f(3)?
What is the value of f(f(3))?

Java uses this same principle, though with many different types of data,
things can get a bit more complex.

Using Fields in Testing
-----------------------

Last week, we worked on creating some simple test suites for a Jeroo.  You
may remember needing to do a lot of set-up work at the start of each test
to ensure the jeroo was exactly where you wanted it and with the right
number of flowers.

However, what if you had several tests in a row that all required the same
initial starting conditions?  To help make testing a bit more streamlined,
you can declare **fields** instead of local variables to hold the common
objects you are using in most or all of your tests. When you do this, instead
of repeatedly declaring them as local variables in each test method, declaring
them as fields makes them visible to *all* test methods so they only need to
be declared once.

Further, rather than repeating the code to set up the initial conditions in
every test method, you can also write that just once, instead of repeating it
in each test method.

To see how this works, consider this example test method from the Software
Testing module:

.. code-block:: java

   public void testPickFlowers()
   {
       // 1. set up initial conditions
       Lab04Island island = new Lab04Island();
       FlowerPicker picker = new FlowerPicker();
       island.addObject(picker, 1, 2);

       // 2. call the method
       picker.pickFlowers();

       // 3. check expected results
       assertThat(picker.getX()).isEqualTo(6);
       assertThat(picker.getY()).isEqualTo(2);
       assertThat(picker.getFlowers()).isEqualTo(5);
       assertThat(picker.getHeading()).isEqualTo(EAST);
   }

Now suppose you were writing a test class with multiple tests in it:

.. code-block:: java

   public class FlowerPickerTest
       extends TestCase
   {
       public void testPickFlowers()
       {
           // 1. set up initial conditions
           Lab04Island island = new Lab04Island();
           FlowerPicker picker = new FlowerPicker();
           island.addObject(picker, 1, 2);

           ...
       }

       public void testPickFlowersAgain()
       {
           // 1. set up initial conditions
           Lab04Island island = new Lab04Island();
           FlowerPicker picker = new FlowerPicker();
           island.addObject(picker, 1, 2);

           // turn picker south and move forward 1
           // for this test

           ...
       }
   }

Here, the two tests both use an ``island`` and both use a ``picker``.
They both have to create the ``island``, create the ``picker``, and place
the ``picker`` on the ``island``. This is just repeated code.

Repeated code is an example of a **code smell**, or a red flag that a
design can be improved. Sometimes you look at code and you just get a
feeling that there is a better way to do it--that's a *code smell*. If
you get that feeling, almost certainly there *is* a better way to do it,
and revising the code would improve it.

First, instead of using local variables called ``island`` and ``picker`` in
each method, we can move those to be fields:

.. code-block:: java

   public class FlowerPickerTest
       extends TestCase
   {
       private Lab04Island island;
       private FlowerPicker picker;

       public void testPickFlowers()
       {
           // 1. No extra setup needed
           ...
       }

       public void testPickFlowersAgain()
       {
           // 1. set up initial conditions
           // turn picker south and move forward 1
           // for this test

           ...
       }
   }

But where do we put the initialization code to create the objects?
While it might seem the constructor would be a good place, a constructor
is executed *once only* when an object is created. But this initialization
code needs to be executed for each and every test method in our class,
not just once.

In test classes, we use a special method called ``setUp()`` for this purpose
(note the capitalization!).
This method will be automatically executed before each of the tests in
the class.  To be clear, that means that if you had 3 tests
called ``test1()``, ``test2()``, and ``test3()``, the ``setUp()`` method
would run before ``test1()`` executes AND before ``test2()`` AND
before ``test3()``. It provides common initialization steps for *all* of
your test methods in the class.

We can use fields with this ``setUp()`` method to efficiently set up our
initial conditions. Programmers often call the common set of initial conditions
used for all of the tests in a class the **test fixture**.

.. code-block:: java

   public class FlowerPickerTest
       extends TestCase
   {
       private Lab04Island island;
       private FlowerPicker picker;
       
       public void setUp()
       {
           this.island = new Lab04Island();
           this.picker = new FlowerPicker();
           this.island.addObject(this.picker, 1, 2);
       }

       public void testPickFlowers()
       {
           // 1. No extra setup needed
           ...
       }

       public void testPickFlowersAgain()
       {
           // 1. set up initial conditions
           // turn picker south and move forward 1
           // for this test

           ...
       }
   }

Note that the fields look slightly different than the original local
variable declarations. They include the keyword ``private`` in front,
because all our fields are private. You can never use ``private`` in
front of a local variable inside a method, only with fields, but we
*always* use it with fields.


Also, inside ``setUp()`` you'll notice that there is no type at the beginning
of each line. We aren't *declaring* local variables inside that method.
Whenever you specify a type in front of a name, you are declaring a new
name in some way.
