Multi-dimensional Arrays
========================

Dimensions in an Array
----------------------

So far when working with arrays, we've worked with
**one-dimensional arrays** where we use a single subscript value to
identify a position. You can imagine a one-dimensional array as a
"line" of values.

However, sometimes you would like to represent data that is easier to
think of as being arranged in a grid or a table instead of just a straight
line. Java supports creating arrays with more than one subscript--which
translates to more than one *dimension*.

A **two-dimensional array** is useful for certain kinds of problems.
We often think of a two-dimensional array as being a rectangular grid,
and use two subscript values instead of one. In fact, it turns out that
if we imagine each individual "row" in the grid is its own one-dimensional
array, then a rectangular grid is actually a series of rows arranged in
a line--an array whose components are themselves arrays.

For example, you might use a two-dimensional of array (or 2D array, for short)
if you are doing a scientific
study in which you have to track the amount of precipitation for every day
of the year, and you wanted to organize the day both by month and day.
One way to organize these data would be to create a one-dimensional
array, consisting of 365 elements:

.. code-block:: java

   double[] rainfall  = new double [ 365 ];

However, with this representation, it would make it very difficult to calculate
the average rainfall within a given month, which might be an important part of
your study.

A better representation for this problem would be to use a two-dimensional array,
with one dimension for the months and one for the days.

The following statement declares the array variable ``rainfall`` and initializes
it to refer to a newly created 12 by 31 array of ``double`` values:

.. code-block:: java

   double[] rainfall  = new double[12][31];

Thus, ``rainfall`` is an array of arrays. You can think of the first array
as the 12 months required for the problem. And you can think of each month
as an array of 31 days. The months will be indexed from 0 to 11, and the
days will be indexed from 0 to 30.

The problem with this representation is that when we want to refer to
the rainfall for January 5, we would have to use ``rainfall[0][4]``.
This is awkward and misleading, since we'd normally write the date as "1/5"
if we were communicating with another person.
The problem is that dates (like 12/31/2021) start their counting at 1, while
arrays start counting at 0.

Because it will be difficult to remember this fact,
our representation of the rainfall data may cause us to make errors when we
start writing our algorithms. We can easily remedy this problem by just
defining our array to have an extra month and an extra day each month:

.. code-block:: java

   double[] rainfall  = new double[13][32];

This representation creates an array with 13 months, indexed from 0 to 12,
with 32 days per month, indexed from 0 to 31. However, we can simply
ignore the 0 month and 0 day by using unit indexing (indexing starting with 1)
in all of the algorithms that process the array. In other words, if we view
this array as a two-dimensional table, consisting of 13 rows and 32 columns,
we can leave row 0 and column 0 unused.

.. odsafig:: Images/ArrayDiagram.png
   :align: center

As the figure above shows, the very first element of this 416-element array
has subscripts (0,0) while the last location has subscripts (12,31). The main
advantages of this representation is that the program as a whole will be
much easier to read and understand and much less prone to error.

In order to refer to an element in a two-dimensional array, you need to
use two subscripts. For the ``rainfall`` array, the first subscript will specify
the month and the second will specify the day within the month. Thus, the
following statements assign 1.15 to the ``rainfall`` element representing
January 5, and then print its value:

.. code-block:: java

   double[] rainfall  = new double[13][32];
   rainfall[1][5] = 1.15; // rainfall for January 1st is 1.15

Just as in the case of one-dimensional arrays, it is an error to attempt
to reference an element that is not in the array. Each of the following
examples would cause an ``IndexOutOfBoundsException`` when executed:

.. code-block:: java

   double[] rainfall  = new double[13][32];
   rainfall[13][32] = 1.15; // no such element
   rainfall[11][33] = 1.15; // no such column
   rainfall[14][2] = 1.15; // no such row

Iterating through a 2D Array
----------------------------

As we've mentioned before, a ``double`` array will automatically initialize
every value to 0.0 so we do not need to initialize the elements unless we
want them to start with a different value. Remember if we were working with
Strings or objects, this would not be the case!

However, for many array problems it is necessary to initialize the array elements
to some other value. For a two-dimensional array, this would require a nested
loop. To illustrate this algorithm, let’s use a nested pair of for loops to
initialize each element of the ``rainfall`` array to 0:

.. code-block:: java

   for (int month = 1; month < rainfall.length ; month++)
   {
      for (int day = 1 ; day < rainfall [month ].length ; day++)
      {
        rainfall [month][day] = 0.0 ;
      }
   }

Note that both for loops start at 1 since we're not using row 0 or column 0.

Remember that when you have a nested for loop, the inner loop iterates faster.
Thus, for each month, the inner loop will iterate over 31 days. This is equivalent
to processing the array as if you were going across each row and then down to
the next row in the representation shown in the picture in the previous section.

Note that for a two-dimensional array, both dimensions have an associated
length, which is used in this example to specify the upper bound of each
for loop.
For the ``rainfall`` array, the first dimension (months) has a length of 13
and the second dimension (days) has a length of 32.

Another way to view the ``rainfall`` array is to remember that it is an
array of arrays.
The length of the first array, which corresponds to the
number of months (13), is given by ``rainfall.length``. The length of
each month’s array, which corresponds to the number of days (32) in a
month, is given by ``rainfall[month].length``.

The outer loop of the nested for loop iterates through months 1 through
12, and the inner for loop iterates through days 1 through 31. In this way,
372 = 12 × 31 elements of the array are set to 0.0.

Syntax Practice: Looping Over 2D Arrays 
---------------------------------------

.. extrtoolembed:: 'Syntax Practice: Looping Over 2D Arrays'

Multi-Dimensional Arrays
------------------------

Java doesn’t limit arrays to just two dimensions. For example, suppose
we decide to extend our rainfall survey to cover a ten-year period. For
each year we now need a two-dimensional array of months and days.
This results in a three-dimensional
array consisting of an array of years, each of which contains
an array of months, each of which contains an array of days:

.. code-block:: java

   int years = 10;
   int months = 13;
   int days = 32;

   double [][][] rainfall = new double[years][months][days];

Following the design convention of not using the 0 month and 0 days, we
end up with a 10 × 13 × 32 array.

In the figure below, each year of the rainfall data is represented as a separate
"page"". On each page, there is a two-dimensional table that consists of 12
rows (1 per month) and 31 columns (1 per day).

.. odsafig:: Images/3DArrayGraphic.png
   :align: center

the following algorithm would be used to initialize all elements of our
three-dimensional rainfall array:

.. code-block:: java

   for (int year = 0; year < rainfall.length ; year++)
   {
       for (int month = 1 ; month < rainfall[year].length ; month++)
       {
           for(int day = 1 ; day < rainfall[year][month].length; day++)
           {
               rainfall[year][month][day] = 0.0;
           }
       }
   }

Note again the proper use of the length attribute for each of the
three dimensions of the array. In the outer loop, ``rainfall.length``,
we’re referring to the number of years. In the middle loop,
``rainfall[year].length``, we’re referring to number of months within
a given year. In the inner loop, ``rainfall[year][month]``.length,
we’re referring to the number of days within a month.

If we added a fourth dimension to our array, to represent different ciites,
for example, and wanted to extend
this algorithm to initialize it, we would simply embed the three-level loop
within another for loop that would iterate over each city.


Initializing a Multi-Dimensional Array
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If we didn't want to use loops like the code above, we could also initialize
our multi-dimensional array using our alternate method we saw for
one-dimensional arrays where you can list out the initial value for
each item within the array inside curly braces ({}).

To recap, we could initialize a one-dimensional array of ``int``\ s like this:

.. code-block:: java

   int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};

For multi-dimensional arrays we could write:

.. code-block:: java

   int[][] grid = {
       // two rows of 3 columns each
       {1, 2, 3},
       {4, 5, 6}
   };
   String[][][] arr3D = {
       // a 2x2x2 "cube" of strings
       {
           {"a", "b"},
           {"c", "d"}
       },
       {
           {"e", "f"},
           {"g", "h"}
       }
   };


Jagged (or Ragged) Arrays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because multi-dimensional arrays in Java are created as an array of arrays,
the individual arrays that represent separate rows are distinct objects in
their own right. As a result, they do not all have to have the same length.
When a multi-dimensional array has sub-arrays of different sizes, it is called
"jagged" (or sometimes "ragged") instead of "full" or "rectangular". Jagged
arrays have rows of uneven (unequal) sizes. Sometimes they are used to
represent *sparse matrices*, but can be used for other situations as well.
 
Below, we see an array of ``double``\ s consisting of three rows, each of
which has a different number of elements. The first row contains three
elements, the second
contains two elements, and the last row contains four elements. As this
last example shows, the rows in a multidimensional array don’t all have
to have the same length.

.. code-block:: java

   double[][] arrDifferent = {
       {1.0, 2.0, 3.0},
       {4.0, 5.0},
       {6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0}
   };

Initializing arrays like this by writing out the specific cell values is
feasible only for relatively small arrays.
To see why, just imagine what the initializer expression would be for our
three-dimensional rainfall array. It would require 4,160 (or 10 × 13 × 32)
zeroes, separated by commas! However, it can be really useful for
describing smaller arrays. It is also the primary way Java allows programmers
to record literal values representing sets of typed-in numbers or strings,
and so arrays initialized this way are often used to provide tabular
data literals in Java programs.

But Can You Have Multi-dimensional Lists?
-----------------------------------------

One of the advantages that arrays provide over lists is that they have
built-in support for stacking as many dimensions as necessary. ``List``\ s,
on the other hand, have only a single dimension and a single integer position
value you can use in their ``get()`` method.

Or do they? It turns out that just as a multi-dimensional array in Java
can be thought of as an "array of arrays", you can use the same concept
to create a "list of lists" if you need a multi-dimensional list. After
all, a list can contain any type of object, and lists themselves are
objects, so it makes sense that you can put lists inside lists.

   </div>


Integer Division and Modulus
----------------------------

Suppose you have a measurement in inches and you want to convert to feet and
inches. The goal is divide by 12 (the number of inches in a foot) and keep the
remainder.

We have already seen the division operator (``/``), which computes the quotient
of two numbers. If the numbers are integers, it performs integer division, which
throws away any fractional part of the answer, discarding any remainder.

Java also provides the **modulus** operator (``%``), which divides two numbers
and computes the remainder.

Using division and modulus, we can convert to feet and inches like this:

.. code-block:: java

   int quotient = 76 / 12;  // division
   int remainder = 76 % 12; // modulus

The first line yields 6. The second line, which is pronounced “76 mod 12”,
yields 4. So 76 inches is 6 feet, 4 inches.

The modulus operator looks like a percent sign, but you might find it helpful
to think of it as a division sign (÷) rotated to the left.

The modulus operator turns out to be surprisingly useful. For example, you
can check whether one number is divisible by another: if ``x % y`` is zero, then
``x`` is evenly divisible by ``y`` with no remainder.

For example, if we wanted to write an if statement that only ran if an ``int x``
was divisible by 5, we'd write:

.. code-block:: java

   if (x % 5 == 0)
   {
       // do some action
   }

You also can use modulus to "extract" digits from a number:
``x % 10`` yields the rightmost digit of x, which is the same as the remainder
after dividing x by 10. Similarly, ``x % 100`` yields the last two digits.
You can combine this with division, since ``x / 10`` is the digits *without*
the rightmost digit. For example, the number 1234 consists of 123 (which
is ``x / 10``) followed by 4 (which is ``x % 10``).

Also, many encryption algorithms use the modulus operator extensively.

Here are two really short videos you can check out that will help explain
modulo arithmetic as well:
