Java Unit Testing
=========================

Objectives
----------

Upon completion of this module, students will be able to:

* Review the basics of a java class including fields, constructors, methods, parameters, and use of the keyword this
* Review debugging code and code coverage
* Implement variations for JUnit assert statements

Interactive: Introduction to Hokie Class
----------------------------------------

In this discussion we will be revisiting good testing practices with an example class called "Hokie Class".

       Download to run and explore the java file (see below) from the video on your own in eclipse. You may download the standalone \*.java file for this example. To run the standalone \*.java file you will need to 
           1) create a new Eclipse project, then 
           2) create a package within the project called “example” (the package named at the top of the class MUST match the package the file is placed in within the Eclipse project), and finally 
           3) download and import the standalone \*.java file(s) to the created package.

Intro to Hokie Class JUnit Testing
----------------------------------

A Note about Assert Statements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So far in the course when we want to test that a piece of code acted the way we wanted, we'd run a statement like:

.. code-block:: java

   assertThat(<something we want to check>).isEqualTo(<expected value>);


This is a more modern style that's intended to be more readable. However, there is a different form of syntax you can use to create assertions:


.. code-block:: java

   assertEquals(<expected value>, <something we want to check>);

This second kind of assert statement is more commonly used today, but it can be tricky to use correctly.  When using ``assertEquals``, it can be easy to put the value we want to check first and the expected value second.

For example, say we wanted to check that a variable ``x`` was equal to 5.

.. code-block:: java

   int x = 4;
   assertEquals(x, 5);

Writing like this would be syntactically correct, but potentially confusing because the failure message would read "Expected [4] but got [5]".  In reality, we were *expecting* 5 but *got* 4.

Videos in the second half of the course will be using this second, more commonly used syntax.  You can continue to use either version.  Below, is a table of assertions in both styles. Remember both the isEqualto() and assertEquals() methods use the equals method for the object parameters, be sure to understand how the corresponding equals method works for the objects being compared.

.. list-table:: Assertions
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Task
     - AssertThat Style
     - Traditional Style
     - Notes
   * - Checking that ``x`` is equal to 5
     - ``assertThat(x).isEqualTo(5);``
     - ``assertEquals(5, x);``
     - While the new style has a ``.isNotEqualTo()``, there is no ``assertNotEquals()`` in the old style
   * - Check that a double ``x`` is equal to double ``y``
     - ``assertThat(x).isEqualTo(y, within(0.01));``
     - ``assertEquals(y, x, 0.01);``
     -
   * - Checking that ``x`` is ``true``
     - ``assertThat(x).isTrue();``
     - ``assertTrue(x);``
     -
   * - Checking that ``x`` is ``false``
     - ``assertThat(x).isFalse();``
     - ``assertFalse(x);``
     -
   * - Checking that ``x`` is ``null``
     - ``assertThat(x).isNull();``
     - ``assertNull(x);``
     -
   * - Checking that ``x`` is *not* ``null``
     - ``assertThat(x).isNotNull();``
     - ``assertNotNull(x);``
     -
   * - Checking two object variables refer to the same space in memory
     - ``assertThat(obj1).isSameAs(obj2);``
     - ``assertSame(obj2, ob1);``

    </center>



Use JUnit
~~~~~~~~~
To make a JUnit test class in eclipse:

#. Right-click the class you’re creating a test class for in the Package Explorer

#. Click: `New > Class` (creating a JUnit Test Case isn’t CS2-Support compliant)

#. Name the class Test. (i.e. HokieTest, ArrayBagTest)

#. Click finish (You may want to check the box for ‘generate comments’ if you wish)

#. Add an import statement: import student.TestCase

#. Add that your class extends TestCase.

#. Project Build Path should be configured to have CS2-Support project included (note that CS2-Support needs to be open to appear as an option)

#. Declare instance variables

   * Create at least one field of the object of the class you are testing.

#. Write setUp method

#. Use the setUp() method to initialize your object(s), it will be run before each test method.

#. Write test methods for each method in class being tested

   * Create at least one test method for each of the methods in your class. Each method in your test class needs to start with ‘test’ or else it will not run correctly! (i.e. testGetName, testAdd) For a test method, call the corresponding method on the object and use assertion statements to test your code.

#. Write additional test methods as needed. A simplified test class example for the Student class:

.. code-block:: java

   public class StudentTest extends student.TestCase
   {
      private Student janeDoe;

      public void setUp()
      {
         janeDoe = new Student(“Jane Doe”);
      }

      public void testGetName()
      {
         assertEquals(“Jane Doe”, janeDoe.getName());
      }
   }



Run a JUnit Test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To run a JUnit test class:

#. Right-click the test class in the Package Explorer

#. Click: `Run as > JUnit Test` A JUnit window should pop-up and display green if all of your tests are correct and red if one more has failed.


Naming Conventions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For classes: Add Test to the end of the class name

* example: HelloWorld is the class; HelloWorldTest is the test class

For methods: start the test method with test

* example: foo is the method; testFoo is the test method

Instance Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Use instance variables to hold values for testing

* AKA field variables, member variables

* scope of instance variable is all instance methods so variable can be used in multiple tests

* in the example above, `janeDoe`` is an instance variable


setUp Method
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The `setUp()` method runs before each test method.

* Use this method to initialize instance variables

* Must be called *setUp* – remember to make that U uppercase!

Code coverage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write tests that test average cases

* example: In a list, test for adding to the middle

Write tests that test edge cases

* example: In a list, test for adding at the beginning of a list


N simple conditions, N+1 branches and tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Assertions in a test method need to make it to every condition of an if-else statement. It isn’t enough that the test reaches the ‘else’ condition. To test an if-else statement properly, the body of each condition must be run during testing.

.. code-block:: java

   if (x == 0 && y ==1) // 2 conditions, 3 checks- TF, FT, TT

   if (x == 0 || y == 1) // 2 conditions, 3 checks- TF, FT, FF

Clarification for edge and average cases- For a list that contains 100 values, you must check for indices -1, 0, 99, 100, and something in between.

Example: say we had the following:

.. code-block:: java

   if ( score >= 90 )
   {
      System.out.println( “Your grade is an A”);
   }
   else if ( score >= 80 )
   {
      System.out.println( “Your grade is a B”);
   }
   else if ( score >= 70 )
   {
      System.out.println( “Your grade is a C”);
   }
   else if ( score >= 60 )
   {
      System.out.println( “Your grade is a D”);
   }
   else
   {
      System.out.println( “Your grade is an F”);
   }

Your test class would have to test for all 5 of the above possibilities in order to execute every single line of code in the block of if-else statements.

Sometimes the best way to test your code is to clean your code first!

Cleaning up your code before you test it can save lots of time. In addition, the way you structure your code may make it easier to test correctly.

Example: Say we had written the following inside of a method:

.. code-block:: java

   if ( A > B )
   {
      if ( C != 0 && ( A > B ))
      {
         // do something
      }
   }
   
We can easily clean up this if statement by noticing that we are evaluating A > B twice when it’s unnecessary. We can re-write it as the following:

.. code-block:: java

   if ( A > B )
   {
      if ( C != 0)
      {
         // do something
      }
   }
   
We might decide to un-nest them as well:

.. code-block:: java

   if ( (A > B) && ( C != 0) )
   {
      //do something
   }
   
Now, it’s easier to see all the conditions that need to be tested.

Simplify Testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When testing a method with multiple if-else statements, it can usually simplify testing to split each possibility into its own test method.This can be particularly helpful when making sure you’re reaching every condition in a more complex if-else statement block ( a common Web-CAT error ).

Say we are testing a method with the following if-else statement in it:

.. code-block:: java

   if ( A > B)
   {
      //do something
   }
   else
   {
      //do something else
   }

It might be a good idea to have one test method evaluate this if statement when A > B is true and another test method evaluate the same if statement when A > B is false.

   :long_name: Checkpoint 3


Testing Exceptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you throw them, then catch them in your testing!

Use a `try-catch` block in your testing to check if your code has thrown the right exception. In your try block, you should call the method that results in an exception being thrown. The catch block should catch the exception thrown. Then assert that the exception exists, is the correct exception, and (if applicable) contains the correct message.

Example: Say you are trying to access an element in a data structure that cannot be accessed by using an iterator object, so you are testing to check if a NoSuchElementException is thrown with the message “There are no more elements left to iterate over.”. The following inside of a test method will determine if you caught the right exception correctly:

Example:

.. code-block:: java

   Exception thrown = null;

   try
   {
      //call the method that should throw a NoSuchElementException
      iterate.next();
   }
   catch (Exception exception)
   {
      //”Catch” and store the exception
      thrown = exception;
   }
   //assert that an exception was thrown
   assertNotNull(thrown);

   //assert that the correct exception was thrown
   assertTrue(thrown instanceof NoSuchElementException);

   //Check the message of the exception is correct
   assertEquals(thrown.getMessage(), "There are no more elements left to iterate over.");

   :long_name: Checkpoint 4

Testing toArray() methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `toArray()` method returns an Object array containing each element found in a given collection.

Testing the `toArray()` method requires that we confirm that the actual array of Objects returned by the method matches an expected array of Objects.

Note that the `assertEquals` and `assertTrue` methods do NOT provide a mechanism to readily compare two arrays because arrays do not have an equals method defined.  We ``CANNOT`` simply perform the following:

.. code-block:: java

   Object[] expectedArray = {"A","B","C","D"};

   Object[] actualArray = {"A","B","C","D"};

   assertEquals(expectedArray, actualArray);

Using the assert in this manner would result in a failed test and an **AssertionFailedError** (see image below).

.. odsafig:: Images/eclipse_failure_trace.png
   :align: center


**nor** can we use:

.. code-block:: java

   assertTrue( expectedArray.equals( actualArray) );

We need therefore need an alternative option.

One approach is to iterate through the elements of each array, comparing each element in one array with the corresponding element in the other array. If any pair do not match then we can conclude that the two arrays are not equal and therefore return false.  Note that we must check ALL of the elements of an array against their counterparts before we can determine if they are equal or not.  They will only be equal if we did not encounter any two pairs that were not equal to each other. In this case, for example, we would start by comparing the elements at index 0, i.e. compare expectedArray[0] against actualArray[0],then index 1, i.e. compare expectedArray[1] against actualArray[1], and so on until completed.

Consider using the for loop to help with such a task.

General JUnit Testing Tips
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Debugging a broken test can be tedious, especially in bigger projects.  To make the process easier on yourself, Make sure each test case covers exactly 1 logical component.  For instance let’s consider this abbreviated form of our Hokie class:

.. code-block:: java

   public class Hokie {
      private String pid;
      private String hometown;
      private int graduationYear;
      private int DOBYear;

      public boolean setDOBYear(int year) {
         if (year > 0 && (year < 3000)) {
               DOBYear = year;
               return true;
         }
         return false;
      }


      public String toString() {
         return pid;
      }
   }

We could create a test case like this:

.. code-block:: java

   public void test1(){
      // Tests setDOBYear
      assertTrue(elena.setDOBYear(1968));
      assertEquals(1968,elena.getDOBYear());
      assertFalse(john.setDOBYear(12031995));


      // tests toString
      Hokie gobbler = new Hokie("gobbledee",1973);
      assertEquals("gobbledee",gobbler.toString());
   }


   public void test1(){
         // Tests setDOBYear
         assertTrue(elena.setDOBYear(1968));
         assertEquals(1968,elena.getDOBYear());
         assertFalse(john.setDOBYear(12031995));


         // tests toString
         Hokie gobbler = new Hokie("gobbledee",1973);
         assertEquals("gobbledee",gobbler.toString());
   }


However if test1 fails, to debug it you now must consider a potential error in the test or a potential error in the setDOBYear() method or in the getDOBYear() method or in the toString() method.  Eclipse will direct you to the line that failed but that may not always tell you where the problem actually started!  Either way, it’s good practice to write a test method for 1 and only 1 logical component of your code.  Dividing these two into separate tests will make debugging easier down the road.

In bigger programs, it may not be enough to make 1 test per method either.  Consider the following code:

.. code-block:: java

   public int foo(int x, int y){
   for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++){
      x+=i;
      if (x % 3 == 0){
         x++;
      }
      y *= i;
   }
   if (x % 2 == 0){
      return x;
   }else if (y % 2 == 0){
      return y;
   }
   return 0;
   }

You may find it easier to write one test case that handles the logic inside the for loop and a separate test case for the conditionals outside of it.  That way if one fails, you know exactly where in your code to look!
