.. _EthicsMoralMach: 

Explore the Moral Machine
-------------------------


Deciding on the most ethical course of action for every situation or set of
circumstances is not always an easy task.  While leveraging the previously
mentioned guidelines and resources will help us to distinguish between actions
and decisions that are ethical vs those that are not, there are many scenarios
where we may find ourselves dealing with an ethical dilemma, a scenario where
we may need to choose between two options, neither of which are acceptable or
preferable.

Consider for example, the question of  “How to program a computer to decide on
the most ethical course of action?” This is obviously a complex situation, one
that can be made more complex depending on the  type of computer system in
question.

Let us explore the computer system for a self driving car.  How do we program
a self driving car to make ethical decisions, especially in circumstances
where lives are affected?

The Moral Machine is a site designed to help us answer this very question.

We invite you to visit this
`Moral Machine website <http://moralmachine.mit.edu/>`_
View the video on the landing page, then click on the “judge” option at the top
of the page.  You will be presented with a number of scenarios and questions on
ethical dilemmas.  This exercise will help you explore ethical dilemmas and
reflect upon what you have learned so far as well as the criteria you use to
make ethical decisions.  Complete the questions on the site then continue on
to the next page within the canvas module.
