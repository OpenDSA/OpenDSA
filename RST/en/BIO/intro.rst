Introduction
============

  **What will learn in book**


  **What is the OpenDSA?**

 OpenDSA is infrastructure and materials to support courses in a wide variety of Computer Science-related topics such as Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), Formal Languages, Finite Automata, and Programming Languages. OpenDSA materials include many visualizations and interactive exercises.
 Our philosophy is that students learn best when they engage the material and then practice it until they have demonstrated their proficiency.
 OpenDSA provides a place for students to practice skills and develop knowledge with a variety of exercises including small code writing problems, proficiency exercises where students demonstrate knowledge of an algorithm by interacting with a data structure, and questions about knowledge

  **In This Book**
 Learning abstract concepts in data structures and algorithms (DSA) courses is often difficult for student.
 To improve understanding of DSA topics, numerous algorithm visualization (AV) systems and stand-alone AVs have been developed, supporting a wide range of algorithms and different engagement strategies. Prior studies show that active engagement of students is necessary to make AVs educationally effective. In this paper, we introduce JSAV, a new
 JavaScript framework for creating engaging algorithm visualizations with active learning features.
