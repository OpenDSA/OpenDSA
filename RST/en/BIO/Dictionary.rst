Dictionary
==========
**Python dictionary** is an unordered collection of items. Each item of a dictionary has a key/value pair.

Dictionaries are optimized to retrieve values when the key is known.

**Creating Python Dictionary**

Creating a dictionary is as simple as placing items inside curly braces {} separated by commas.

* An item has a key and a corresponding value that is expressed as a pair (key: value).

* While the values can be of any data type and can repeat, keys must be of immutable type (string, number or tuple with immutable elements) and must be unique.

**Why do we need dictionaries?**

As a dictionary, keeps the elements in key-value mapping format and internally uses hashing for it; therefore, we can get a value from the dictionary by its key very quickly. In best cases, its complexity is O(1), whereas, in the worst case, its complexity can be O(n).

**Changing and Adding Dictionary elements**

Dictionaries are mutable. We can add new items or change the value of existing items using an assignment operator.

If the key is already present, then the existing value gets updated. In case the key is not present, a new (key: value) pair is added to the dictionary.
