Dot Matrix
==========

   **The dotplot is a simple picture that gives an overview of the similarities between two sequences**.Less obvious is its close relationship to alignments.
   The dotplot is a table or matrix. The rows correspond to the residues of one sequence and the columns to the residues of the other sequence. 
   In its simplest form,
   **the positions in the dotplot are left blank if the residues are different, and filled if they match**. Stretches of similar residues show up
   as diagonals in the upper left–lower right (northwest–southeast) direction.
   DNA sequence is compared with its reverse-complemented sequence.Parallel diagonals represent the inverted repeats.
   **The dotplot gives a quick pictorial statement of the relationship between two sequences**. 
   Obvious features of similarity stand out.
