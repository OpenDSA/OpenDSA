Construct a program that prints out all the circles that are larger than 5.

.. extrtoolembed:: 'ps_python_dict_filter'
   :learning_tool: mastery-grid-jsparsons-python

ps_python_bigger_than
--------------------------------
Assume that num1 and num2 have been initialized to numbers, so that number1 is bigger. Construct a pro- gram that correctly prints out that number1 is indeed bigger

   :learning_tool: mastery-grid-jsparsons-python

ps_python_conditionals_temperature
----------------------------------
Construct a program that outputs “Cold”, when the temperature is 15 degrees Celcius or below. It prints “Moderate” when the temperature is over 15 degrees but no more than 25 degrees. If the temperature is over 25 degrees, it prints “Hot”.

ps_python_printing_file_contents
-------------------------------------
Construct a program that opens up a file and prints out each line of the file.
