Bowling Test Coverage Example
=============================

Bowling Test Coverage Example
-----------------------------

Here is another example to let you practice testing.
This is testing a bowling game.
Each frame starts with 10 pins, the user enters the number of pins hit
by each roll of the ball.
Hitting all 10 points with one roll is a strike.
Knocking down all 10 points on two rolls is a spare.

Try to get at least 75% code coverage.
