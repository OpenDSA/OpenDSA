Project 3 Design
----------------

.. slide:: Project 3 Design

   | Implement Quicksort
   |    On disk as a big virtual memory
   |    The disk file is mediated by a buffer pool for better
        performance
   |       The goal is to minimize disk I/O   
   | Small project: No parser, no world controller, just a main, a
     sort, and a buffer pool


.. slide:: Disk File

   | You will use RandomAccessFile to access the disk file
   |    This gives the needed basic functionality (read/write/seek)
   |    This is "unbuffered" (we provide our own buffering via the
        buffer pool)


.. slide:: Records: Binary Data

   | Records to sort are 4-byte quantities
   |    2 byte key and 2 byte data field
   |    Don't grab the wrong bytes, or get them out of order!
   | Most of the time you simply copy clumps of 4 bytes (swap)
   | When you need to get the key out:
   |    Best approach is to wrap the 4-byte quantity in a ByteBuffer
   |    Use getShort() to pull out the key value
   | "ASCII" vs. "Binary" files
   |    The only difference is that the "ASCII" files have keys and
        values selected so that they happen to print nicely
   |    One side effect is that there are lots of duplicate keys in
        "ASCII" files


.. slide:: Performance

   | Most tests have a time limit.
   | Most of those can easily be met if your buffer pool is
     implemented correctly.
   |    Only read if the corresponding block is not in memory
   |    Only write when the block is flushed (not every time block is
        altered)
   | One or two tests require something more. Two approaches
   |    Improve the algorithm implementation (see OpenDSA)
   |    Code tune: Look especially at wasted creation/destruction of
        temporary byte arrays

        
.. slide:: Project Staging

   #. Download starter kit. Submit to Web-CAT. Look at the test case
      info.
   #. Make the Quicksort work with a stubbed buffer pool that is
      simply holding the array in memory. Replace Quicksort [] with
      method calls. Make sure that you read keys and swap records
      correctly.
   #. Start adding buffer pool functionality until that works
      completely and efficiently.
   #. Do final optimizations to pass tests.
