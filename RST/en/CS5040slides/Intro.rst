   Content Goals for this Course

   * Reinforce the concept that costs and benefits exist for every data
     structure.
   * Learn the commonly used data structures.
      * These form a programmer's basic data structure "toolkit".
   * Understand how to measure the cost of a data structure or program.
      * These techniques also allow you to judge the merits of new data
        structures that you or others might invent.


.. slide:: Costs and Benefits

   * Each data structure has costs and benefits.
      * Rarely is one data structure better than another in all
        situations.
      * We talk about a lot of data structures and algorithms that
        have stood the test of time.
   * Any data structure requires:
      * space for each data item it stores,
      * time to perform each basic operation,
      * programming effort.
   * Only after a careful analysis of problem characteristics can we
     know the best data structure for a task.

     
.. slide:: Data Structure: Definition

   * A data structure is the physical implementation of an ADT.
      * Each operation associated with the ADT is implemented by one
        or more subroutines in the implementation.
   * Data structure usually refers to an organization for data in main
     memory.
   * File structure: an organization for data on peripheral storage, such
     as a disk drive.

     
.. slide:: Logical vs. Physical Form

   * Data items have both a logical and a physical form.

   * Logical form: definition of the data item as an ADT.

     * Ex: Integers in mathematical sense: operators +, -

   * Physical form: implementation of the data item within a data
     structure.

     * Ex: 32/64 bit integers, overflow.
