Project 1 Design
----------------

.. slide:: Project 1

   | Be aware of project due date, milestone due dates
   | Aim to get it done PRIOR to the EARLY BONUS date.
   | You need to write a "scanner" or "parser" to read info from
     command file (text).
   | You need to use command line parameters
   |   See Tutorials in Chapter 2 of OpenDSA
   |   For parsing: Use Scanner Class [2.7] or
       Pattern/Matcher classes

       
.. slide:: Project 1 Class Organization (1)

   | Q: When do you need separate classes?
   |   Wrong A: When they get too long
   |   Right A: When they separate meaningfully different behavior
   | Things you need in this project
   |   Multiple data structures (hash table class, memory manager class)
   |   "Main" routine, that sets things up
   |   Command syntactic parsing (separate the behavior, NOT the code length)
   |   Command semantic processing (separate the behavior, NOT the code length)
           
.. slide:: Project 1 Class Organization (2)

   | Bad:
   |   Main Class (Scanner/interpreter)  ==> Main Data Structures           
   | Good:
   |   Main (Program parameters, initialization) ==>
   |     Parser (Syntactic processing of commands) ==>
   |       "Database" or "World" (semantic processing of commands) ==> 
   |         Various data structures classes
           
.. slide:: Scheduling the project

   | Most people find these projects to be hard and/or time consuming
   |   Need some planning structure
   |   Milestones help to enforce time management
   |   Incremental Development is crucial to success
   | Scheduling the project:
   |   1. Main/Parser first.
   |   2. World Database class next.
   |   3. Hash table, implemented with direct access to strings in memory
          (hidden behind record interface)
   |   4. Memory manager last!
         

.. slide:: General Project Info              

   | You are usually banned from using standard Java data structures
     classes
   |   You may **not** use things like ``HashMap``, ``ListArray``, ``Vector``
   |     Exception: You may use ``ListArray`` to thelp you with
         processing the keywords in the parser.
   |   You may use standard language features like arrays
   |   You may use string and file manipulation classes/methods that
       make parsing of the command file easy.          

.. slide:: Good Design Practice

   | Good names matter. REALLY!
   | Every competent software development organization enforces some
     coding style.
   |   Web-CAT enforces a particular coding style.
   | Generalize your container classes (hash table, memory manager)
   |   For P1, your memory manager should not know anything about the
       rest of the project, it just stored bytes
   |   See the Seminar class serializer/deserializer

   
.. slide:: Container Classes: Hash Table

   | The hash table is a container class. A container class is anything
     that stores a collection of arbitrary objects.
   | Want to support any record type. (OK to assume an integer key.)
   | Hide details behind some Record class
   | Need to deal with concept of comparison. Your record should give
     you back the string as its key.
