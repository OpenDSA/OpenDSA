Project 1 Design
----------------

.. slide:: Project 1

   | Be aware of project due date, milestone due dates
   | Aim to get it done PRIOR to the EARLY BONUS date.
   | You need to write a "scanner" or "parser" to read info from
     command file (text).
   | You need to use command line parameters
   |   See Tutorials in Chapter 2 of OpenDSA
   |   For parsing: Use Scanner Class [2.7] or
       Pattern/Matcher classes

       
.. slide:: Project 1 Class Organization (1)

   | Q: When do you need separate classes?
   |   Wrong A: When they get too long
   |   Right A: When they separate meaningfully different behavior
   | Things you need in this project
   |   Multiple data structures (hash table class, memory manager class)
   |   "Main" routine, that sets things up
   |   Command syntactic parsing (separate the behavior, NOT the code length)
   |   Command semantic processing (separate the behavior, NOT the code length)
           
.. slide:: Project 1 Class Organization (2)

   | Bad:
   |   Main Class (Scanner/interpreter)  ==> Main Data Structures           
   | Good:
   |   Main (Program parameters, initialization) ==>
   |     Parser (Syntactic processing of commands) ==>
   |       "Database" or "World" (semantic processing of commands) ==> 
   |         Various data structures classes
           
.. slide:: Scheduling the project

   | Most people find these projects to be hard and/or time consuming
   |   Need some planning structure
   |   Milestones help to enforce time management
   |   Incremental Development is crucial to success
   | Scheduling the project:
   |   1. Main/Parser first.
   |   2. World Database class next.
   |   3. Hash table, implemented with direct access to strings in memory
          (hidden behind record interface)
   |   4. Graph last!
         

.. slide:: General Project Info              

   | You are usually banned from using standard Java data structures
     classes
   |   You may **not** use things like ``HashMap``, ``ListArray``, ``Vector``
   |   You may use standard language features like arrays
   |   You may use string and file manipulation classes/methods that
       make parsing of the command file easy.          

.. slide:: Good Design Practice

   | Good names matter. REALLY!
   | Every competent software development organization enforces some
     coding style.
   |   Web-CAT enforces a particular coding style.
   | Generalize your container classes (hash table, memory manager)
   |   For P1, your Graph should not know anything about the
       rest of the project, it just stores some kind of record

   
.. slide:: Container Classes: Hash Table

   | The hash table is a container class. A container class is anything
     that stores a collection of arbitrary objects.
   | Want to support any record type. (OK to assume an integer key.)
   | Hide details behind some Record class

Project 1 Hashing
-----------------

.. slide:: What you need to know about Hashing

   * Read Module 10.1, Skim 10.3, Read 10.6 carefully, Read 10.7.4
     Double Hashing, Read 10.9 Deletion

   * Feel free to use code posted as part of OpenDSA modules (Insert, search)

   * You can write Hash Table Class **assuming** that it uses the
     given hash function, and that the key is an integer.

      :links: AV/Hashing/collisionCON.css
      :scripts: AV/Hashing/collisionCON6.js
      :output: show


.. slide:: Primary design issue: Communications

   * World/DB/Controller class, Hash Table, Graph need appropriate
     coordination.
   
   * World probably initializes Graph and Hash Tables, and calls controller
     to insert/process records. Store the Node in a Record in the Hash Table
   
   * Hash table does not need to know that there is a Graph.

     
.. slide:: What is stored in the hash table?

   * Clearly there has to be a key, and there has to be a value
     (a node?)
   
   * The key is an string (the artist or song name)

   * The value is probably some kind of Node object 


Project 1 Graphs
----------------

.. slide:: Undirected Graph Representation

   .. inlineav:: GundirRepCON dgm

.. slide:: Connected Components

   .. inlineav:: GconcomCON dgm
      :links: AV/Graph/GraphDefCON.css
      :scripts: AV/Graph/GconcomCON.js
      :output: show

   * The maximum connected subgraphs of an undirected graph are called
     connected components.


.. slide:: Approach

   Each object initially is a separate node in its own tree.

   When two objects are "equivalent", then add them to the same tree.

   Key question: **Given two nodes, are they in the same tree?**

.. slide:: .

.. slide:: Milestone 2

   * Must pass some number of tests, some mutant coverage (from your
     JUnit tests), some style points

   * Functionally: Get the hash table working, at least inserts.
