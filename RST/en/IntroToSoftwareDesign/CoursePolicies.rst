Course Policies
===============

Before getting started, it's important to make sure you're familiar with a few things


Cheating and The Honor Code
---------------------------

Honor code violations are unfortunately common in early computer science courses.  You can also find some of this information on the syllabus but it is critical that you know what is considered cheating in this course and how seriously it is taken.

Students are expected to conduct themselves in an ethical, professional manner, consistent with .. The Virginia Tech Honor Code: https://honorsystem.vt.edu/ .  All **reading quizzes, homework assignments, program assignments, and exams are individual work** and must be written without help from other sources or people, except for the course instructor, the course TAs, and ACM or UPE tutors.

**Labs:** All lab work is turned in individually and must bear your name. **During lab period only**, you may freely offer and receive verbal assistance on lab tasks with your assigned lab partner(s) or any other student in your lab section (but you may not copy anyone else's code!). During lab period only, you are also welcome to help your partner(s) or other students debug or troubleshoot their own code, and are free to seek assistance from your partner(s) or other students with your own coding issues on the lab assignment. However, this form of collaboration is reserved for only your scheduled lab meeting room and time, not for any work done outside of your lab meeting room and time.

**Program Assignments:** All program assignments are also considered **individual work**  that allows you to demonstrate the skills you have learned. You may freely offer and receive verbal assistance on how to use the programming language, what library classes or methods do, what errors mean, or how to interpret assignment instructions with your classmates. However, you **may not give or receive help from others while working on your program code**.  On individual program assignments you must work alone while typing at the keyboard, or viewing your source code on the screen. It is OK to work in the Undergraduate Learning Center (McBryde 106), as long as you are not asking for or receiving assistance from others (except course TAs or approved tutors).

Here are some important definitions for you to keep in mind, pulled from the .. The Virginia Tech Honor Code: https://honorsystem.vt.edu/ .

Definition lists:

Cheating
  Cheating includes the intentional use of unauthorized materials, information, notes, study aids or other devices or materials in any academic exercise, or attempts thereof.

Multiple Submission
  Multiple submission involves the submission for credit of substantial portions of any work (including oral reports) previously submitted for credit at any academic institution, or attempts thereof. In CS 1114, **you may not resubmit work you completed in a different semester--you must write assignments from scratch if you are repeating the course**

Plagarism
  Plagiarism includes the copying of the language, structure, programming, computer code, ideas, and/or thoughts of another and passing off the same as one's own original work, or attempts thereof. In CS 1114, **you may not copy code from another on any assignment.**

Falsification
  Falsification includes the statement of any untruth, either verbally or in writing, with respect to any element of one's academic work, or attempts thereof.

Complicity
  Complicity includes intentionally helping another to engage in an act of academic misconduct, or attempts thereof.

Fabrication
  Fabrication includes making up data and results, and recording or reporting them, or submitting fabricated documents, or attempts thereof.

Note that all electronic work submitted for this course is archived and subjected to automatic plagiarism detection and cheating analysis!

If you have questions or are unclear about what constitutes academic misconduct on an assignment, please speak with your instructor. We take the Honor Code very seriously in this course.

Normally, when honor code violations in this course are caught in this course the result is an **F\* sanction** as a final course grade.  The F represents failure in the course.  The "*" identifies a student who has failed to uphold the values of academic integrity at Virginia Tech. A student who receives a sanction of **F\*** as their final course grade shall have it documented on their transcript with the notation "FAILURE DUE TO ACADEMIC HONOR CODE VIOLATION." You are required to complete an education program administered by the Honor System in order to have the “*” and notation “FAILURE DUE TO ACADEMIC HONOR CODE VIOLATION” removed from your transcript. The “F” however would be permanently on your transcript.

Using Webacat
-------------

In this course, code submissions will be done through an online tool called WebCat.  WebCat can help you by providing some immediate feedback when you submit things.

<TODO: create directions on creating a webcat account?  Update LNT link for new semester>


Using Codeworkout
-----------------

Additionally, in this course, some programming assignments will be completed through an online tool called Codeworkout.
