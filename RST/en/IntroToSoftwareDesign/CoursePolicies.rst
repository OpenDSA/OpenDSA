Read the Course Syllabus
========================

Welcome to CS 1114!

To get started, let's go through the course policies described in the course
syllabus on Canvas to make sure you understand how the course will run, what
your responsibilities are, how you will be graded, and how you should conduct
yourself in class.

Before continuing, please **read the course syllabus** posted on Canvas.


Who Is This Class For?
======================

This course teaches introductory programming in Java, with a significant
emphasis on object-oriented software design and on software testing. In many
ways, it is comparable to the AP Computer Science A course offered at some
high schools. It is taken by students majoring in Computer Science, minoring
in Computer Science, and also by students in other majors thinking about
studying Computer Science.

It can be very helpful if you have already had some exposure to programming.
Basic familiarity with variables and sequential logic will give you a leg up.
However, the course is designed to be approachable by beginners who do not
have any significant programming background.


Students of Many Experience Levels
==================================

While this course is designed and intended for beginners, please be aware
that students from a very wide range of backgrounds take this course, including
some students who may have significant amounts of prior programming
experience. If you are a student with significant prior programming experience
who has taken the AP Computer Science A course and received a score of 4 or 5,
we recommend you use your AP credit to enroll in CS 2114 instead. For other
students, just remember that while there are many reasons why students who
already know how to program might take this course, the course isn't intended
for that audience--they are overqualified. You may see such students in lab
or on the course discussions, asking and answering questions that appear to
require significantly more programming knowledge. The course staff are happy
to answer such questions, but please remember that we do not expect students
in this course to possess that level of knowledge or to perform as if they
have already learned how to program prior to taking this course.

Students with extra experience should not set your expectations about what
is normal or what course staff expect of the bulk of students in this course
who do not already know how to program.


Online and Face-to-face Sections
================================

This course includes a mix of both online lecture and lab sections
as well as in-person (face-to-face) lecture and lab sections. All
sections share the same syllabus, course content, and assignments.
However, be aware that the course website on Canvas and the course
discussion areas involve students from all sections, so you will likely
see questions or information for both groups. In specific assignments,
if there is any difference in instructions between in-person vs. online
sections, it will be clearly described--make sure to follow the instructions
that apply to your section.

We strongly encourage students with prior programming experience to
consider the online sections, and encourage those without any prior
experience to choose in-person sections where possible. Also, due to
the university's Wellness Principles, including the university's
vaccination and masking requirements for Fall 2021, we
encourage students who are exempt from vaccination or who are unable
to wear masks to consider the online sections of the course available
this semester as a safer and more comfortable alternative in those
extenuating circumstances.


Weekly Schedule
===============

This course runs on a weekly schedule, and learning the schedule will help
you develop a routine, anticipate deadlines, and stay on track and in sync
with the whole class. It is extremely important to stay on schedule and
turn your assignments in. The single biggest reason for failing to receive
the grade you want in this course is falling behind on assignments, then
missing deadlines or turning in incomplete work. Use the course structure
to stay on track, so you are adequately prepared for each new topic
covered in the course.

In particular, while the semester starts out with easier topics, please
do not allow yourself to be lulled into believing you can be more lax
with reading or preparing for labs and that you will still be able to
get it done at the last minute. This course has a way of sneaking up
on the unsuspecting who cut corners during the first half of the semester
and expect the same level of difficulty throughout. Regular, weekly engagement
with the course content and regular, weekly practice on your programming
skills is necessary to develop mastery of the concepts and skills taught
in this course.

Throughout the week, pay attention to the following recurring weekly
activities:

* Sunday: Reading Activity due, to prepare for the week's lectures
* Monday: Lecture meeting
* Monday (or Wednesday): In-Class Quiz approximately every other week
* Monday: Lab Assignment for the week posted, get started early
* Tuesday: Program Assignment due, posted the previous week
* Tuesday: New Program Assignment posted, due next week
* Wednesday: Lecture meeting
* Wednesday/Thursday/Friday: Lab assignment due in your scheduled lab meeting


Reading Activities
==================

Each week begins with a Reading Activity due Sunday night. This activity
includes embedded exercises to check your understanding and to allow
you to practice what you are learning. All exercises in a given activity
must be successfully answered to receive an "Excellent" grade for that
activity. The course uses a "flipped classroom" model, so do not expect
the reading material to be duplicated in a traditional lecture style in
class--it is your responsibility to read the material and exercises so
you are ready for the problem solving activities conducted in class
sessions.


Labs
====

Each week also includes a lab assignment that is posted at the beginning
of the week, typically on Monday. Lab assignments are posted early so that
you can read them ahead of time, ask questions if you are unclear on any
of the behaviors or tasks described in the lab, and review any concepts or
skills needed for the lab that you feel unsure about. Further, poosting the
labs early allows you to try your hand at starting out the lab on your own.
We encourage you to start the lab and get a far a you can before you go to
lab.

You will not be able to submit your lab for a grade or any feedback until
the start of your lab period. You can submit your lab as many times a you
want within the deadline, and make corrections based on the feedback you
receive.  You will also have TAs present for your lab period to answer
any questions you have or to help you resolve any errors you are running
into. However, please be aware that your TAs expect you to be prepared and
to do the work. If you have not read the instructions or figured out how to
get started before coming to your lab period, do not expect them to hold
your hand. They are a resource to help steer when you run into problems,
but they are a shared resource used by all the students in your section
rather than a personal trainer. If you are completely unprepared, expect
that you will be unable to finish lab on time and will have to work yourself
after lab to complete the assignment on your own time.

You may also find that some students in the course who have prior programming
experience are able to complete lab assignments on their own before arriving
to their lab meeting. That is ok, but is not the expectation for students who
have no prior experience. Remember that labs are intended as practice activities
to reinforce the concepts you are learning, and it is natural and expected that
you may regularly run into situations where you wish to ask TAs for clarification
or assistance on something you have not seen before. That is what your lab
period is for, and why every lab period is staffed with TAs to answer your
questions, so do make use of them during that time as you learn.


Programming Assignments
=======================

Programming assignments will be given almost every week, posted on Tuesdays
and due the following Tuesday night. Programming assignments typically come
in pairs: one week, your programming assignment will be to work on a brand
new problem setting up your solution and making sure you have a solid
starting point. The next week, your programming assignment will be to fill
in the remainder of that starting point to flesh it out into a full solution.

This semester, we will cover a total of 12 programming assignments, arranged in
6 pairs. Each odd-numbered assignment will start a completely new problem
with setting up your solution, and each even-numbered assignment will involve
building the corresponding solution to a working final product.
This means that the work necessary for the first assignment in each
pair is an integral element of your solution for the second assignment of the
pair the following week. So even if you fail to turn in the first part, you
will still need to make up the work in order to successfully complete the
second half. Please keep this in mind when planning how to approach the
programs.

We recommend that students schedule in fixed periods of programming time to
work on programming assignments each week. The best time may be between the
end of your lab meeting and the following Monday. Complete as much of your
assignment as you are able by each Monday so that you can ask any questions
you run into on the Canvas discussion area for that assignment or during
TA office hours. It is not uncommon for students who start late and plan to
do each program assignment the night it is due to run into unexpected
situations, and then have no time to ask questions or get assistance before
the program assignment is due, so plan ahead so you build in regular time
periods to work on programming.


Late Assignments
================

As detailed in the syllabus, students are allowed to turn in Reading Activities,
Lab Assignments, and Programming Assignments up to 5 days late. There is
no grade penalty for this, but please remember your weekly schedule. Delaying
assignments is the fastest way to fall behind in the course, and working
past a deadline will take away time that should be spent on the next
round of weekly activities. For In-Class Quizzes, there are no late
submissions. Verified absences with a letter from the Dean of Students,
together with an appropriate explanation of the emergency reason for your
absence, are necessary to request a make-up quiz, which is only given at the
discretion of the instructor.


Grading
=======

This course is being graded using a form of "Specification Grading",
where completion of an assignment is determined by the evidence the
work provides about mastery of the corresponding concepts or skills.
Most assignments can be submitted as many times as you like for automated
feedback so that you can practice and refine your skills to the point
where you can demonstrate them successfully. We use the EMRN scale
(described in the syllabus) to indicate successful completion of each
assignment.

The letter grade you will receive for this course is based on the
number of assignments you successfully complete, plus the score you
receive on the final exam. The syllabus specifies the minimum number of
completed assignments (receiving either an M or E grade) you must
achieve in each category. You must meet the minimums in every assignment
category to receive a specific letter grade. Except for the final
exam, grading is based on the number of assignments successfully
completed, and for higher letter grades, which successfully completed
assignments received an "Excellent" score.


Programming Language and Environment
====================================

This course teaching programming using Java. We will use the BlueJ IDE
for code development in class, including all examples shown in lecture.
See the "Install BlueJ" link on the course home page for installation
instructions--please be sure to download and install directly from Canvas
instead of going to the ``bluej.org`` website. The version on Canvas includes
the necessary user libraries necessary for assignments in this course,
and lab or programming assignments will not compile without these.


Cheating and The Honor Code
===========================

.. topic:: Excerpt from Honor System Policy

    Academic misconduct is a corrosive force in the academic life of a university, jeopardizing the quality of education and depreciating the genuine achievements of others. Actively deterring academic misconduct is, without reservation, the responsibility of all members of the Virginia Tech community. Apathy or acquiescence in the presence of academic misconduct is not a neutral act – failure to confront and deter such behavior will reinforce, perpetuate, and enlarge the scope of such misconduct.

    [...]

    Virginia Tech students are expected to uphold and to encourage other students to abide by the Honor Code. A primary responsibility of Virginia Tech students is to refrain from any form of violation of the Honor Code.

Honor code violations are unfortunately common in early computer science
courses, and the Office of Academic Integrity has seen a significant
rise in violations during the past year. It is important for all students
to understand how serious these issues are. You must complete the following
Canvas modules:

1. Enroll in and earn the badge for the: `Academic Integrity Success Module <https://canvas.vt.edu/enroll/CE7YK9>`_
2. Between August 31 - September 3, enroll in and earn the badge for the: `Understanding the Code <https://canvas.vt.edu/enroll/7HR4PF>`_

Remember that there are certain issues you can freely discuss with each
other in order to learn. In this course, you may freely offer and receive
verbal assistance with your classmates on the following topics:

* how to use the programming language
* what library classes or methods do
* what errors mean
* how to interpret assignment instructions

However, you **may not give or receive help from others** while working on
your program code or any graded assignments. When writing program code for
any class assignment, you **must work alone while typing at the keyboard**,
or while **viewing your source code on the screen**. Yes, that means showing
your assignment code or work to other students is an Honor Code violation,
as is reading or looking at code or work written by fellow students.

Further, note that if you have taken CS 1114 in a previous semester, you
**may not submit your work from a previous semester** and must redo work
from scratch. Resubmitting work from an earlier semester does not demonstrate
your current level of understanding or ability, and does not reflect whether
your skills have degraded. Instead, repeating the work is important for
increasing your skills so that you can successfully complete the course
this time.

Also, please remember that when any students are reported for cheating on any
assignment in this course, we recommend they receive the **F* sanction**, a
grade that indicates on your transcript the F is the result of an Honor Code
violation. Further, students with an F in CS 1114 are required to repeat and
successfully complete the course before they can take subsequent CS courses,
which can negatively impact your planned timeline for graduation. For students
in General Engineering, it can also reduce your competitiveness when applying
to change your major.

    "As a Hokie, I will conduct myself with honor and integrity at all times. I will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor will I accept the actions of those who do."
