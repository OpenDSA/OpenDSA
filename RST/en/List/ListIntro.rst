Chapter Introduction: Lists
===========================

If your program needs to store a few things |---| numbers,
payroll records, or job descriptions for example |---| the simplest
and most effective approach might be to put them in a list.
Only when you have to organize and search through a large number of
things do more sophisticated data structures like
:term:`search trees <search tree>`
become necessary.
Many applications don't require any form of search,
and they do not require that an ordering be placed on the objects
being stored.
Some applications require that actions be performed in a strict
chronological order, 
processing objects in the order that they arrived,
or perhaps processing objects in the reverse of the order that they
arrived.
For all these situations, a simple list structure is appropriate.

This chapter describes representations both for lists and for
two important list-like structures called the :term:`stack` and the
:term:`queue`.
Along with presenting these fundamental data structures, the other
goals of the chapter are to:

1. Give examples that show the separation of a logical representation
   in the form of an ADT from a physical implementation as a data
   structure.

2. Illustrate the use of asymptotic analysis in the context of
   simple operations that you might already be familiar with.
   In this way you can begin to see how asymptotic
   analysis works, without the complications that arise when analyzing
   more sophisticated algorithms and data structures.

We begin by defining an :ref:`ADT for lists <ListADT>`.
Two implementations for the list ADT |---| the
:ref:`array-based list <ListArray>` and the
:ref:`linked list <linked list> <ListLinked>` |---| are covered in
detail and their relative merits discussed.
The chapter finishes with implementations for
:ref:`stacks <stack> <stack>` and
:ref:`queues <queue> <Queue>`.
