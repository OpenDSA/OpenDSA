Introduction to Turing Machines
===============================

A General Model of Computation
------------------------------

In this module we seek to define a general model of computation that
is as simple as possible.
The reason is that we want to be able to understand the limits of what
is possible in computing, but that is rather hard to do with a
complicated definition for a "computer" is.
But then, we need to be confident that whatever model we do pick, that
it actually represents all of the fundamental capabilities of a
"computer".
Specifically, we want a model that is capable of computing any funtion
that our "regular" computers can compute.

"State machines" are simple to understand.
There are a number of different state machines, with a range of
capabilities.
We will discuss a particular one, called a :term:`Turing machine`.

If you take a Formal Languages course, you will learn about a number
of simple state machine types, like deterministic and
non-deterministic :term:`finite automata <Finite Automata>`,
and :term:`pushdown automata` (PDA).
These machines all have some similarities.
They all take an input string.
They all march across the string from left to right, one character at
each step.
They stop when they reach the end of the string and then make a
simple decision: If the machine is in a final state, then it accepts
the string (as being in the language of strings accepted by the
machine),
and otherwise it rejects the string.
In other words, they are :term:`acceptors <acceptor>` for some language.
All that they can do is determine if a string is a member of the
language (of course that is a pretty useful ability),
and the "more powerful" machines can accept or reject strings
from more "complicated" languages.

But there is a lot more that we typically expect when we talk about
"computation".
Like, well, the ability to "compute" rather than simply accept.
What does "compute" actually mean?
For example, we would like to be able to take as input the arithmetic
expression ":math:`2 + 3`" and do more than decide if it is a
syntactically correct arithmetic statement.
We would like to be able to compute the answer: 5.
This means that we need to be able to output that computed value.
Or to be precise, we "compute" a value by taking the input
string ":math:`2 + 3`" and replacing it with the output string "5".

In its most general form, we can think of everything that a computer
does as taking some string as input, and then providing some string as
output.
Of course, modern peripheral devices like keyboards, mice, and computer
monitors give us rich ways to express input strings (perhaps as button
presses), and rich ways to interpret output strings (say, as
pictures).
But it's not a huge stretch of the imagination to see that there is no
loss of ability if we abstract all computation
as converting an input string to an output string.

This concept of converting is far more powerful than simple accepting.
A machine that takes an input and provides an output is called a
:term:`transducer`.

In the next section, we will introduce a simple machine,
called the :term:`Turing Machine`, that is a transducer.
It is only slightly more complicated than other state machines.
These differences might appear suprisingly small considering how
significant they are.
Ultimately, we will see that a Turing Machine can do any computation
(in its fundamental abilty to convert one string into another)
that even the most sophisticated modern computer can do.

The first difference is memory.
Simple Deterministic (DFA) and Non-Deterministic (NFA) State Machines
have no memory beyond knowing their current state,
and so are not affected by the history that got them to that state.
In contrast, PDAs have a stack.
This makes a huge difference in what languages can be accepted:
DFAs only accept what is called a :term:`regular language`, while
(nondeterministic) PDAs accept any :term:`context-free language`.

Consider these three languages:

* :math:`L_1 = \{wcw^R\}` for :math:`w` in :math:`\Sigma^*, \Sigma = \{a, b\}`.
* :math:`L_2 = \{ww^R\}` for :math:`w` in :math:`\Sigma^*, \Sigma = \{a, b\}`.
* :math:`L_1 = \{ww\}` for :math:`w` in :math:`\Sigma^*, \Sigma = \{a, b\}`.

The differences seem pretty minor, but the outcomes are quite
different.
:math:`L_1` is a deterministic context-free language.
:math:`L_2` is a non-determistic context-free language.
:math:`L_3` is not a context-free language at all.

The difference between :math:`L_3` and the others seems to relate to
the limitiations of using a stack as memory.
As we read the first :math:`w` and load it into the stack, we don't
have a good way to get to the bottom of the stack to see the first
letter to compare it against the first letter of the second :math:`w`.
But what if we considered other memory models?
For example, a queue would solve our problem nicely.
But then, a queue would not be able to handle :math:`L_2`.
Two stacks could simulate a queue (do you see how?), and so a machine
with two stacks can handle both :math:`L_1` and :math:`L_2`.
Perhaps we should investigate what class of languages a two stack
machine can handle?
Perhaps we should consider other memory models?

As it turns out, none of these ideas are as effective as the simple
memory model that the Turing Machine uses.

Interpreting Turing Machines
----------------------------

Next we will look at notation for discussing the concept of
configurations and transistions between configurations for Turing
machines.
We will investigate more about the conventions of halting, accepting,
and computing for Turing machines.
Finally, we will present notation for doing real computation on numbers.
