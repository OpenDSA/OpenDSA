RP 13 part 1
------------

Topics of the day:

  1. Continuations
  2. Continuation-passing style programming

The review problem set for today contains five review problems.

This first problem is about a recursive function to compute the
greatest common divisor (or :math:`gcd`) of two integers.

RP 13 part 2
------------

This review problem is the first one in a sequence of three problems
that require you to complete the implementation of a recursive
function that uses continuation-passing style programming. This
problem uses the :math:`gcd` function introduced in the first problem
in this set, but you do not need to remember how it was implemented.

RP 13 part 3
------------

This review problem is the second one in a sequence of three problems
that require you to complete the implementation of a recursive
function that uses continuation-passing style programming. This
problem uses the :math:`gcd` function introduced in the first problem
in this set, but you do not need to remember how it was implemented.

RP 13 part 4
------------

This review problem is the last one in a sequence of three problems
that require you to complete the implementation of a recursive
function that uses continuation-passing style programming. This
problem uses the :math:`gcd` function introduced in the first problem
in this set, but you do not need to remember how it was implemented.

RP 13 part 5
------------

This randomized review problem will give you more practice writing
recursive functions in the continuation-passing style. To get credit
for it, you must solve it correctly three times in a row.
