Functional Programming - Part 1 
===========================================
.. (W 2/10/16)
   
RP 5 part 2
-----------

Topics of the day:

  1. How to add annotations to a Jison grammar to produce an
     interpreter, rather than just a parser (see previous chapter)
  2. Introduction to functional programming

The review problem set for today contains five review problems.  The
first one (see previous chapter) is about grammars. The four remaining
problems are in this section.

This problem deals with the syntax and semantics of the ``fp.cons`` function.

RP 5 part 3
-----------

This problem deals with the semantics of the ``fp.hd``, ``fp.tl``, and
``fp.cons`` functions. Note that this problem is randomized. You must
solve it correctly three times in a row to earn the point associated
with it.

RP 5 part 4
-----------

This problem deals with the syntax and semantics of the ``fp.hd``,
``fp.tl``, and ``fp.isEq`` functions.
