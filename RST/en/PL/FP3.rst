RP 7 part 1
-----------

Topics of the day:

  1. Discusssion of "deep recursion," which can handle trees
     represented as lists of lists of ... lists of integers.

The review problem set for today contains four review problems.

This first problem will give you one more example of deep recursion.

RP 7 part 2
-----------

This problem again deals with deep recursion and more specifically with the
``subst`` function that was previously described.

RP 7 part 3
-----------

This problem is similar to (and assumes that you have solved) the
previous problem.

RP 7 part 4
-----------

This problem will give you a lot more practice with deep
recursion. This is a randomized exercise. So you have to solve it
correctly three times in a row.
