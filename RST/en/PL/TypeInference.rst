Type Inference
==============

Type Environments
-----------------

A **type environment** is an environment associating expressions with data
types (instead of with values, as did the environments we have used in
our interpreters so far).

For example, fill in the following question marks for a type
environment *tenv* assuming your language is Java:

  ``[ [true, ???],  [1, ???], [3.4, ???] ]``

Typing Rules Expressed as Post Systems
--------------------------------------

Typing rules are specified relative to a type environment by a
conditional specification known as a *Post system*.  The "givens" in
this conditional specification are specified above a dashed line.  The
conclusion(s) that can be drawn from the "givens" are specified below
the dashed line.

For example, here is a possible typing rule in type environment *tenv*:

::

    type-of E1 is bool
    type-of E2 is T                             {Note: T stands for any type}
    type-of E3 is T
    ------------------------------------
    type-of (if E1 then E2 else E3) is T

Does this rule accurately describe JavaScript's type system? Java's type system?

Typing in a Scaled-down ML
--------------------------

Since we’re going to discuss typing issues, particularly parametric
polymorphism and type inferencing, in the context of the  `programming
language ML`_, let’s begin by rigorously providing the syntax for a
very small subset of ML. For the moment, think of it as a statically
typed lambda calculus with ints, reals, bools, and conditionals.

.. _programming language ML: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language)

::

    <type> ::= <type-variable>
               | int
               | bool
               | real
               | <type> -> <type>                      {Example: int -> bool is the type of a predicate}

    <expr> ::= <identifier>
               | fn <identifier> => <expr> 
               | <expr> <expr>                         {Note: function applications don't have to be parenthesized}
               | if <expr> then <expr> else <expr> 

Using Post System Rules to Describe Type Inferencing in ML
----------------------------------------------------------

We’ve already provided a Post system that describes the type of an
if-then-else expression. We now need Post system rules for function
definitions and function applications.

In type environment *tenv*:
    
::

    type-of <identifier> is T1                           {Note: T1 and T2 stand for any types}
    type-of <expr> is T2
    -----------------------------------------------
    type-of (fn <identifier> => <expr>) is T1 -> T2

    In type environment tenv:

    type-of <expr1> is T1 -> T2
    type-of <expr2> is T1
    ------------------------------
    type-of <expr1> <expr2> is ???                       {What should ??? be?}

Another example of a Post system rule for mini-ML is, for a given type environment:

::

    type-of x is bool
    type-of y is int
    ---------------------------------------------------
    type-of (fn x => fn y => if x then 1 else y) is ???  {What should ??? be?}



Below are examples of how the ML type-inferencing engine responds to
some function definitions. In each example, the first line is a function
definition typed in by the programmer; and the second line is ML's output
of the type it inferred for the given definition.



Now put yourself in the place of the ML type-inferencing engine and try to
determine why ML responds in the way it does using the previously
defined Post system rules.

::
    
   val g = fn x => fn y => if x then 1 else y;
     fn : bool -> int -> int
   val add1 = fn x => x + 1;
     fn : int -> int  
   val add1r = fn x => x + 1.0;
     fn : real -> real
   val double = fn x => x + x;
     fn : int -> int
   val doubler = fn (x:real) => x + x;
     fn : real -> real

Parametric Polymorphism in ML
-----------------------------

To understand what parametric polymorphism is, consider the difference
between the following two identity functions *id1* and *id2* in Java.

::

       public static int id1( int a ) {
           return a;
       }

       public static < E > E id2( E a ) {
           return a;
       }

       System.out.println(id1(4));

       System.out.println(id2("Hello"));

Which one of the methods above exhibits parametric polymorphism?

Let's now turn our attention to how parametric polymorphism is handled in ML.

ML uses a static, safe type-inferencing interpreter with
parametric polymorphism. Make sure you understand the meaning of each
stated feature of ML's type system before continuing.

ML's type-inferencing algorithm will always re-construct the least
restrictive type possible for a variable or parameter. That’s why it has type
variables, such as *'a* and *'b*. ML type variables, that is, variables that
stand for types instead of values, always start with an apostrophe.

For example, a variable whose type is inferred to be *'a list* is a
list whose elements all have the same type, but this type can be any
type. So the type variable *'a* could stand for the type int, or the
type bool, or even the type int list, in which cases the *'a* list is
an int list (containing only integers), or a bool list (containing
only Boolean values), or even an int list list (containing only int lists),
respectively. Instances of these three types of lists are shown below.

Let's first get our heads around ML lists:

::

    [true, false, true]                                  {ML will infer this is a bool list}
    [true, false, true, false]                           {ML will infer this is a bool list}
    [1,2,3,4,5]                                          {ML will infer this is an int list}
    ["foo", "bar", "baz"]                                {ML will infer this is a string list}
    [17, "foo"]                                          {ML will infer this is ILLEGAL}
    [ [1,2,3], [4,6], [0,233] ]                          {ML will infer this is an int list list}
    [ [1,2,3], [4,6], [0,233], [ [1], [2,3] ] ]          {ML will infer this is ILLEGAL}

Make sure you understand why the last list above is illegal.

The *hd* and *tl* functions in ML are just like their counterparts in
the *fp* module we used. However, to cons onto a list, you must use the *::*
operator (or cons operator).  For example, *1::[2,3]* yields the list *[1,2,3]*.

Now for the parametric polymorphic punchline.  Consider how ML reasons
about the following functions involving lists.

::

    val rec sumlist = fn lst => if lst = nil                          {Note: nil is the same as the empty list []}
                        then 0
                        else (hd lst) + (sumlist (tl lst));

    ML's response: sumlist = fn : int list -> int			

    val rec lengthlist = fn lst => if lst = nil
                        then 0
                        else 1 + (lengthlist (tl lst));

    ML's response: lengthlist = fn : ''a list -> int

Again, *'a* (you can ignore the second preceding apostrophe here) is a
type variable indicating that *lengthlist* will accept a list of any
type, in contrast to *sumlist*, which will only work on a list of
integers. Can you figure out why this is the case?
   
Type inferencing in ML
----------------------

All ML functions are functions of one argument.  When we want to have
the equivalent of a function with multiple arguments in ML, there are
two strategies.  The first is to use :ref:`currying` as we have
previously described.  The second is to use a single argument that is
an ML *tuple*. Here are examples of tuples in ML:

::

            (17, "foo")                     int * string
            (12.5, 13.5, 9)                 real * real * int
            (true, false, true)             bool * bool * bool

Hence the following function with one tuple argument acts like a
function of three arguments.

::

   val add3 = fn (x,y,z) => x + y + z;

And ML’s type inferencer will tell us the following about the type of *add3*:

::
   
   add3 = fn : int * int * int -> int 

In contrast:

::

    val add3curried = fn x => fn y => fn z => x + y + z;

is a curried version of the same function whose type signature ML infers to be:

::
   
   add3curried = fn : int -> int -> int -> int
    
       
.. **Time for you to play the role of ML’s type inferencer**
.. 
.. Here are three expressions, each of them a function definition, that are
.. typed into ML.
.. 
.. ::
.. 
..     val x = fn y => if true then 1 else 0;
..     val x = fn (f, g, h) => if f (g = h) then h else 5;
..     val x = fn (f, g, h) => if g f then h f else f;
..     val x = fn f => fn g => fn h => if g f then h f else f;
.. 
.. Match each of them with responses that ML provided as the types of the
.. functions.
.. 
.. ::
.. 
..     fn : 'a * ('a -> bool) * ('a -> 'a) -> 'a
..     fn : (bool -> bool) -> int -> int -> int
..     fn : 'a * ('a -> 'a) * ('a -> bool) -> 'a
..     fn : (bool -> bool) * int * int -> int
..     fn : 'a -> ('a -> bool) -> ('a -> 'a) -> 'a
..     fn : 'a -> int

Consider one more type inference example:

::

    val rec map = fn (f,lst) => if lst = nil
                            then []
                            else (f (hd lst))::(map (f, (tl lst)));

What does ML infer about this function? What does the keyword *rec* mean?

Type Inferencing Problem 1
--------------------------

Six numbered ML expressions are listed below. Each one of them is a
function definition that has been typed into ML.

**SIX ML FUNCTION DEFINITIONS**
::

    1  val x = fn (f, g, h) => if g < h then f else if g <= f then h else 5.5;
    2  val x = fn f => fn g => fn h => if g < h then f else if g <= f then h else 5.5;
    3  val x = fn f => fn g => fn h => if f g then f else if g > 4.5 then h else f;
    4  val x = fn (f, g, h) => if f g then f else if g > 4.5 then h else f;
    5  val x = fn (f, g, h) => if g f then f h else (h + 3);
    6  val x = fn f => fn g => fn h => if g f then f h else (h + 3);

Six type-inferencing responses that ML provided when the six
expressions above were entered are listed below.  Unfortunately,
they have become scrambled. In the six practice problems that
follow, you will help match each type-inferencing response with the correct
ML expression above.

**ML'S TYPE INFERENCE RESPONSES (SCRAMBLED)**
::
   
    1  fn : (real -> bool) -> real -> (real -> bool) -> real -> bool 
    2  fn : (int -> int) * ((int -> int) -> bool) * int -> int 
    3  fn : (real -> bool) * real * (real -> bool) -> real -> bool 
    4  fn : real * real * real -> real 
    5  fn : (int -> int) -> ((int -> int) -> bool) -> int -> int 
    6  fn : real -> real -> real -> real

above are referenced in each one of the following six practice
