Lazy Lists
==========

Infinite Sequences
------------------

**Implementing call-by-name**

Macro-expansion may be implemented with a double textual substitution
(as in the C++ pre-processor) or with a single substitution and
dynamic scoping.  The result is the evaluation of the entire function
body in the caller's environment.  But how to implement call-by-name?
How to evaluate the arguments in the caller’s environment but the rest
of the body in the callee’s environment?

Instead of simply passing a textual representation of the argument, we
pass in a parameterless anonymous function that returns the argument.
Such an anonymous function is called a **thunk**.

Understanding the difference between passing an argument that is
evaluated before calling the function and passing a thunk is to understand the
difference between

.. math::

   \begin{eqnarray*} 
   7
   \end{eqnarray*}	  

and

.. math::

   \begin{eqnarray*} 
   \verb+function ( ) { return 7; }+
   \end{eqnarray*}	  

The former,
when passed as an argument, is already evaluated.  The function can
use that value without having to do anything else to it.  However, the
latter, when passed as an argument, requires that the thunk be
invoked to "unwrap" the value that the function should be using in
its computation.
 
Instead of evaluating the argument before calling the function and
using that value in the function, every time a parameter is referenced
in the function body, the thunk is evaluated to obtain the argument’s
value.  The evaluation process is often referred to as *thawing the
thunk*.

If the thunk contains a reference to a free variable, such as the *x*
in the following example:

.. math::

   \begin{eqnarray*} 
   \verb!function ( ) { return x + 7; }!
   \end{eqnarray*}	  

then the callee (that is passed the thunk as an argument) will be able
to access the free variable that was defined in the caller's
environment.  This is because the thunk is a function, in other words
a closure that includes the environment that existed at the time the
thunk was created (i.e., the caller's environment that contains the
definition of *x*).
   
**Call-by-name lists**

To illustrate the use of thunks, we will implement call-by-name lists,
which are similar to the way lists are used by default in
Haskell or as a programmer-chosen option in Python and Scala.
Call-by-name lists essentially give you **lazy lists**, and we will
see that they can also be thought of as "infinite sequences".  This
perspective offers a very different approach to the way in which one
works with such lists.

Below is documentation for some of the functions that we will provide
in a JavaScript module for infinite sequences called the **is**
module.

The constructor for sequences (i.e., the **cons** function) takes two
arguments, namely the element we want at the head of the sequence and
a thunk that will return the tail of the sequence if we ever need to
go beyond the first element.  For simplicity, we will only manipulate
infinite sequences of integers.  

::

   // Construct a new sequence comprised of the given integer and thunk
   var cons = function (n,thunk) { ... };

   // Get the first integer in the  sequence
   var hd = function (seq) { ... };

   // Get the infinite sequence following the first element.  This
   // will itself be in the form of an integer followed by a thunk
   var tl = function (seq) { ... };
   
   // Return the (finite, non-lazy) list containing the first n
   // integers in the given sequence
   var take = function (seq,n) { ... };

The following slide show illustrates how we could use these operations
to construct and then expose various parts of an infinite sequence of
1s.

   :output: show


Let's now turn our attention to how these four basic functions in the
**is** module, i.e.,  *cons, hd, tl*, and *take*, are implemented.  The
underlying representation of a lazy list is a two-element array *seq*.
*seq[0]* stores the head of the list, which is already evaluated, and
*seq[1]* stores the thunk that must be evaluated to expose the
remainder of the list.

::

   // Construct a new sequence comprised of the given integer and thunk
   var cons = function (x, thunk) {
     return [x, thunk];
   };

   // Get the first integer in the  sequence
   var hd = function (seq) {
     return seq[0];
   };

   // Get the infinite sequence following the first element.  This
   // will itself be in the form of an integer followed by a thunk
   var tl = function (seq) {
     return thaw(seq[1]);
   };

   // thaw is a helper function for tl. It returns the result
   // of evaluating the function given as argument
   var thaw = function (thunk) { return thunk(); };
   
   // Return the (finite, non-lazy) list containing the first n
   // integers in the given sequence
   var take = function (seq, n) {
     if (n === 0)
       return [];
     else {
       // Get a copy of the result of recursive call with n - 1
       var result = take(tl(seq), n - 1).slice(0); // slice(0) gives a copy of the array
       // And use Javascript's unshift to put the hd at the beginning of result
       result.unshift(hd(seq));
       return result;
     }
   };

So far the only sequence that we have been able to create has been a
boring sequence consisting of all ones.  To make it easier to
construct more interesting sequences, in addition to *cons, hd, tl*,
and *take*, the **is** module has some utility functions that are
"infinite analogues" to their counterparts in finite lists (our **fp**
module).  All of these utility functions (i.e., *from, map, filter,
iterates*, and *drop*) are discussed and illustrated below.

* The **from** operation:

..     // return a new sequence obtained by filtering the given sequence with the given predicate
..     var filter = function (pred,seq) {
..         if (pred(hd(seq))) {
..             return cons ( ?????? );
..         } else {
..             return ??????;
..         }
..     };
.. 
..     // return a new sequence obtained by repeatedly applying the given function to the
..     // previous term of the sequence (starting with the given integer).   That is, return
..     // the sequence n, f(n), f(f(n)), f(f(f(n))), ...
..     var iterates = function (f,n) {

**The Sieve of Erastosthenes: an example that takes advantage of lazy lists**

The need to compute various prime numbers occurs in a variety of
applications, for example, public-key encryption.  A long known
technique to compute all of the prime numbers up to a limit *n* with
reasonable efficiency is the *Sieve of Erastosthenes*.  The slide slow
below describes the sieve algorithm in a language with eager (as
opposed to lazy) evaluation.

.. inlineav:: LazyLists7CON ss

   :links: AV/PL/LazyLists/LazyListsCON.css
   :scripts: AV/PL/LazyLists/LazyLists7CON.js
   :output: show

There is a problem with this algorithm, however, from the perspective
of its utility.  Think about how well it can respond to the requests
regarding primes that we might want to ask of it.  While it can handle
a request like "Find all primes less than or equal to n", it comes up
short on requests like "Find the first 1000 prime numbers" or "Find
the first prime number larger that 1 billion".  The reason for this is
that the underlying eager evaluation of the algorithm is limited by the
finite nature of the value *n* that it is given.  On the other hand,
with lazy evaluation of lists, we need not be bound by a finite *n*.
Instead we can construct the infinite sequence of primes, relying on
repeated applications of a thunk to take us to any point in the
sequence that we need to reach.  The following slide show demonstrates
how the Sieve of Erastosthenes would be implemented using lazy lists.

**Call-by-need**
   
What's the difference between our call-by-name implementation of
infinite sequences and the way it is done in Haskell?  In Haskell, the
analogue of the **is.tl** and **is.take** functions are done with
*call-by-need* instead of *call-by-name*. In call-by-need, the value
returned by a thunk is stored (that is, cached) after it is thawed for
the first time. This is much more efficient since it never results in
a thunk being thawed more than once.

Now it's your chance to get some practice with infinite sequences in
the following problems.

The following  problem will help you better understand code that creates
call-by-name infinite sequences.
