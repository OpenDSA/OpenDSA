Parsing Command Line Parameters In Your Program
===============================================

Parameters In Programming
-------------------------

You probably understand the concept of parameters for a function.
But how does a Program itself have parameters?
This comes in the Main function that every Java program has.
Consider this the "launch" function.
Usually the "main" function is named Main and takes an array of
strings as its parameter, like this.

::

   public static void main(String[] args)


So when you launch the command from the terminal it passes in an array of all
the additional information (and it usually trims white space).
So if I run

.. odsafig:: Images/parameterexample.png
   :width: 500
   :align: center
   :capalign: justify
   :figwidth: 90%
   :alt: ls with paramaters


then `args` is an array containing::

   {"-l", "file.txt"}

Note while this is true for Java, it is a little different for C or C++.
In C, the first parameter that you are given is always the command name so
your array in C would be::

   {"ls", "-l", "file.txt"}

Java however, removes the command name and only provides parameters.

I have created a main function skeleton for you to use in your projects. It is
set up simply and makes use of switch cases. You can |external_link1|.
Let's see how it works.

We have our main function take an array of Strings (named args).
If that array is empty then we may or may not want to exit as we have
no parameters.
It will then progress into a while loop that iterates through all
parameters.
The syntax of this loop is useful as it does not lock parameters into
any fixed order.
You can invoke them any way you wish.
The switch case statement allows you to easily write for any parameter
and add a case for unrecognized parameters by using the default case
for any non matching parameters.
In this example I choose to exit after printing the unrecognized
string.
In the future you may wish to change this to something else.
You can learn more about |external_link2|.
It is also important to note that this function will possibly throw an
exception or behave in an unexpected way if you use "-f" but do not
give a file name.
For example if you call the program with {"-f", "-v"}, this will set
the filename to -v.
Or if you call the program with {"-f"}, you will get an exception for
trying to access outside the array bounds.
You can prevent this by using a try-catch, but I chose to keep this
example very simple.
Once you have your parameters set, you can call the appropriate
methods to launch your program.
There you go, simple command line parsing!
