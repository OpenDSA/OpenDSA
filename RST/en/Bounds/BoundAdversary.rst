Adversarial Lower Bounds Proofs
===============================

Our next problem will be finding the second largest in a
collection of objects.
Consider what happens in a standard single-elimination tournament.
Even if we assume that the "best" team wins in every game,
is the second best the one that loses in the finals?
Not necessarily.
We might expect that the second best must lose to the best,
but they might meet at any time.

Let us go through our standard "algorithm for finding algorithms" by
first proposing an algorithm, then a lower bound, and seeing if they
match.
Unlike our analysis for most problems, this time we are going to count
the exact number of comparisons involved and attempt to minimize this
count.
A simple algorithm for finding the second largest is to first find the
maximum (in :math:`n-1` comparisons), discard it, and then find the
maximum of the remaining elements (in :math:`n-2` comparisons) for a total
cost of :math:`2n-3` comparisons.
Is this optimal?
That seems doubtful, but let us now proceed to the step of attempting
to prove a lower bound.

.. topic:: Theorem

   The lower bound for finding the second largest value is :math:`2n-3`.

.. topic:: Proof

   Any element that loses to anything other than the maximum cannot be
   second.
   So, the only candidates for second place are those that lost to the
   maximum.
   Function ``largest`` might compare the maximum element  to
   :math:`n-1` others.
   Thus, we might need :math:`n-2` additional comparisons to find the
   second largest.

This proof is wrong.
It exhibits the :term:`necessary fallacy`:
"Our algorithm does something, therefore all algorithms solving
the problem must do the same."

This leaves us with our best lower bounds argument at the moment
being that finding the second largest must cost at least as much as
finding the largest, or :math:`n-1`.
Let us take another try at finding a better algorithm by adopting a
strategy of divide and conquer.
What if we break the list into halves, and run `largest` on each
half?
We can then compare the two winners (we have now used a total of
:math:`n-1` comparisons), and remove the winner from its half.
Another call to ``largest`` on the winner's half yields its second
best.
A final comparison against the winner of the other half gives us the
true second place winner.
The total cost is :math:`\lceil 3n/2\rceil - 2`.
Is this optimal?
What if we break the list into four pieces?
The best would be :math:`\lceil 5n/4\rceil`.
What if we break the list into eight pieces?
Then the cost would be about :math:`\lceil 9n/8\rceil`.
Notice that as we break the list into more parts,
comparisons among the winners of the parts becomes a larger concern.

Looking at this another way, the only candidates for second place
are losers to the eventual winner, and our goal is to have as few of
these as possible.
So we need to keep track of the set of elements that have lost
in direct comparison to the (eventual) winner.
We also observe that we learn the most from a comparison when both
competitors are known to be larger than the same number of other
values.
So we would like to arrange our comparisons to be against
"equally strong" competitors.
We can do all of this with a \defit{binomial tree}.
A binomial tree of height :math:`m` has :math:`2^m` nodes.
Either it is a single node (if :math:`m=0`), or else it is
two height :math:`m-1` binomial trees with one tree's root becoming
a child of the other.
Let's see how a binomial tree with eight nodes would be constructed.

   :keyword: Lower Bounds Proofs; Adversary Arguments

The resulting algorithm is simple in principle:
Build the binomial tree for all :math:`n` elements, and then compare
the :math:`\lceil \log n\rceil` children of the root to find second
place.
We could store the binomial tree as an explicit tree structure, and
easily build it in time linear on the number of comparisons as each
comparison requires one link be added.
Because the shape of a binomial tree is heavily constrained,
we can also store the binomial tree implicitly in an array, much as we
do for a heap.
Assume that two trees, each with :math:`2^k` nodes, are in the array.
The first tree is in positions 1 to :math`2^k`.
The second tree is in positions :math:`2^k+1` to :math:`2^{k+1}`.
The root of each subtree is in the final array position for that
subtree.

To join two trees, we simply
compare the roots of the subtrees.
If necessary, swap the subtrees so that tree with the the larger root
element becomes the second subtree.
This trades space (we only need space for the data values, no node
pointers) for time (in the worst case, all of the data swapping might
cost :math:`O(n \log n)`, though this does not affect the number of
comparisons required).
Note that for some applications, this is an important observation that
the array's data swapping requires no comparisons.
If a comparison is simply a check between two integers, then of course
moving half the values within the array is too expensive.
But if a comparison requires that a competition be held between two
sports teams, then the cost of a little bit (or even a lot) of book
keeping becomes irrelevent.

Because the binomial tree's root has :math:`\log n` children,
and building the tree requires :math:`n-1` comparisons,
the number of comparisons required by this algorithm is
:math:`n + \lceil \log n \rceil - 2`.  
This is clearly better than our previous algorithm.
Is it optimal?

We now go back to trying to improve the lower bounds proof.
To do this, we introduce the concept of an :term:`adversary`.
The adversary's job is to make an algorithm's cost as high as
possible.
Imagine that the adversary keeps a list of all possible inputs.
We view the algorithm as asking the adversary for information about
the algorithm's input.
The adversary may never lie, in that its answer must be consistent
with the previous answers.
But it is permitted to "rearrange" the input as it sees fit in order
to drive the total cost for the algorithm as high as possible.
In particular, when the algorithm asks a question, the adversary
must answer in a way that is consistent with at least one remaining
input.
The adversary then crosses out all remaining inputs inconsistent with
that answer.
Keep in mind that there is not really an entity within the computer
program that is the adversary, and we don't actually modify the
program.
The adversary operates merely as an analysis device, to help us reason
about the program.

As an example of the adversary concept, consider the standard game of
Hangman.
Player A picks a word and tells player B how many
letters the word has.
Player B guesses various letters.
If B guesses a letter in the word, then A will indicate
which position(s) in the word have the letter.
Player B is permitted to make only so many guesses of letters
not in the word before losing.

In the Hangman game example, the adversary is imagined to hold a
dictionary of words of some selected length.
Each time the player guesses a letter, the adversary consults the
dictionary and decides if more words will be eliminated by accepting
the letter (and indicating which positions it holds) or saying that
its not in the word.
The adversary can make any decision it chooses, so long as at least
one word in the dictionary is consistent with all of the decisions.
In this way, the adversary can hope to make the player guess as many
letters as possible.

Before explaining how the adversary plays a role in our lower bounds
proof, first observe that at least :math:`n-1` values must lose at
least once.
This requires at least :math:`n-1` compares.
In addition, at least :math:`k-1` values must lose to the second
largest value.
That is, :math:`k` direct losers to the winner must be compared.
There must be at least :math:`n + k - 2` comparisons.
The question is: How low can we make :math:`k`?

Call the **strength** of element ``A[i]`` the number of
elements that ``A[i]`` is (known to be) bigger than.
If ``A[i]`` has strength :math:`a`, and ``A[j]`` has
strength :math:`b`, then the winner has strength :math:`a + b + 1`.
The algorithm gets to know the (current) strengths for each element,
and it gets to pick which two elements are compared next.
The adversary gets to decide who wins any given comparison.
What strategy by the adversary would cause the algorithm to learn the
least from any given comparison?
It should minimize the rate at which any element improves it strength.
It can do this by making the element with the greater strength win at
every comparison.
This is a "fair" use of an adversary in that it represents the
results of providing a worst-case input for that given algorithm.

To minimize the effects of worst-case behavior, the algorithm's best
strategy is to maximize the minimum improvement in strength by
balancing the strengths of any two competitors.
From the algorithm's point of view, the best outcome is that an
element doubles in strength.
This happens whenever :math:`a = b`, where :math:`a` and :math:`b` are
the strengths of the two elements being compared.
All strengths begin at zero, so the winner must make at least
:math:`k` comparisons when :math:`2^{k-1} < n \leq 2^k`.
Thus, there must be at least :math:`n + \lceil \log n\rceil - 2`
comparisons.
So our algorithm is optimal.
