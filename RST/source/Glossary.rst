   comparable
      The concept that two objects can be compared to determine if they
      are equal or not, or to determine which one is greater than the other.
      To be reliably compared for a greater/lesser relationship,
      the values being compared must belong to a total order.
      ``Comparable`` is also the name of an interface in Java that
      asserts a comparable relationship between objects with a class,
      and ``.compareTo()`` is the ``Comparable`` interface method that
      implements the actual comparison between two objects of the class.

   comparator (or comparator function)
      A function given as a parameter to a method of a library
      (or alternatively, a parameter for a C++ template or a Java
      generic).
      The comparator function concept provides a generic way
      encapulates the process of performing a comparison between two
      objects of a specific type.
      For example, if we want to write a generic sorting routine, that
      can handle any record type, we can require that the user of the
      sorting routine pass in a comparator function
      to define how records in the collection are to be compared.

   diminishing increment sort
      Another name for Shellsort.

   key
      A field or part of a larger record used to represent that record
      for the purpose of searching or comparing.

   key-record pair
      A standard solution for solving the problem of how to relate a
      key value to a record (or how to find the key for a given
      record) within the context of a particular index.
      The idea is to simply stores as records in the index pairs of
      keys and records.
      Specifically, the index will typically store a copy of the key
      along with a reference to the record.
      The other standard solution to this problem is to pass a
      comparator function to the index methods.

   sorting problem
      Given a set of records :math:`r_1`, :math:`r_2`, ..., :math:`r_n`
      with key values :math:`k_1`, :math:`k_2`, ..., :math:`k_n`,
      the :dfn:`Sorting Problem` is to
      arrange the records into any order :math:`s` such that records
      :math:`r_{s_1}`, :math:`r_{s_2}`, ..., :math:`r_{s_n}`
      have keys obeying the property
      :math:`k_{s_1} \leq k_{s_2} \leq ... \leq k_{s_n}`.
      In other words, the sorting problem is to arrange a set of records so
      that the values of their key fields are in non-decreasing order.

   search key
      A field or part of a record that is used to represent the record
      when searching. For example, in a database of customer records,
      we might want to search by name.
      In this case the name field is used as the search key.

   stable
      A sorting algorithm is said to be :dfn:`stable` if it does not
      change the relative ordering of records with identical key values.

   total order
      A binary relation on a set where every pair of distinct elements
      in the set are comparable (that is, one can determine which of
      the pair is greater than the other).
