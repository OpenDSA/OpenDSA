How to Use this System
======================

**Welcome to OpenDSA!**
OpenDSA is an open source project whose goal is to provide online
course materials for a wide range of Data Structures and Algorithms
courses.
OpenDSA materials are most often presented in the form of a
"textbook".
Your OpenDSA "textbook" is made up of a series of modules.
Each module corresponds to roughly one section in a regular textbook,
or what might get presented in part of a one-hour lecture.
OpenDSA content combines text and images with algorithm visualizations
for all of the algorithms and lots of interactive assessment exercises.
The goal is to let you know if you really understand what you have
been reading.

**Supported browsers:** We support any reasonably recent version of
Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.
There is a pretty good chance that OpenDSA will work on your tablet or
smartphone as well.
Unfortunately, we cannot devote the resources to ensure support for
Internet Explorer, though it usually works there as well.
At this time we have no plans to take any special effort to support
the non-standard requirements imposed by Internet Explorer.

**Registration and Accounts:**
To practice with OpenDSA materials, and to tell if you have completed
an exercise correctly, you do not need to be registered or logged in.
However, to get credit for completing exercises and modules (if your
instructor has assigned these materials to you to do for credit),
or if you just want to have the system remember from session to
session what exercises you have completed, you will need to be logged
in.

You register an account by clicking on the link in the
upper-right corner of any OpenDSA page.
Registration is simple, just fill out the form.
The system will let you use any (unused) name and password for your
account.
If you are doing this for credit, then you should use something that
will be meaningful to your instructor, such as your name or
University ID.

After you register, you will need to then click the "Login" button.
Once you log in, you should see your account name in the upper-right
corner.
You can log out by clicking on the logout link.
You shouldn't really need to logout unless you want another person to
be able to use the same computer to also access the OpenDSA materials
under another account.

**Overview of major elements:**
An OpenDSA module contains a number of interactive components intended
to help you learn the material, in addition to regular text and
graphics.
There are short slideshows that help explain steps of an
algorithm,
there are full Algorithm Visualizations that go through a complete
example of the algorithm,
there are "proficiency exercises" where you show the steps 
taken by an algorithm, there are sets of questions, there are
calculators, and there are other interactive exercises.

**Getting credit:**
You can get completion credit for the following:
Going through a slideshow, completing a proficiency exercise,
completing a question set, or fulfilling the the requirements of the a
calculator or other exercise.
You must be logged in for the system to remember your credit, but you
will usually receive visual feedback if you have completed the
exercise.
If you go through the exercise and *then* log in, the system should
still register your credit.

**Seeing your credit and seeing your current score:**
Most exercises or slideshows will give you visual confirmation when
you have completed it.
If you complete all exercises and slideshows for a module, the title
line will show "Module Complete" in green.
Also, the table of contents page should show a green checkmark beside
the title of completed modules.
You have to be logged in to see information about previous work.

If you are logged in, when you click on your ID in the upper right
corner of the page you will see a list of exercises, your current
score for the exercise, and the total points possible for the
exercise. At the bottom of the page will be your current point total.

**Slideshows:**
Slideshows are controlled by the buttons at the top.
"<" and ">" buttons will back up or advance by one slide, while "<<"
and ">>" will take you to the beginning or end of the slideshow.
You get credit for a slideshow just for progressing to the end (one
step at a time).
A green checkmark should show up on the right when you get credit.

**Visualizations:**
While the slideshows are used to demonstrate a part of an algorithm on
a fixed input, the visualizations let you run the whole algorithm on
input that you can choose.
Generally these have some parameters that you can set (such as number
of elements in an input array, and the values of the input).
The "Run" button will start the visualization.
It will also restart the visualization with new data values if you did
not specify your own input.
"Reset" will typically clear all of the input fields and restart the
visualization.
Many visualizations have a "Help" button to give detailed information
about that particular visualization.

**Question Sets:** Most modules finish with a collection of multiple
choice, True/False, or type-a-number questions.
To get credit for one of these exercises, you will have to correctly
answer some number of questions correctly (the exact number required
is different for each question set).
Once you have credit, the button above the exercise turns green.
You can still get more questions at that point if you would like more
practice.
There is also a "streak" bar that shows your current progress.
If you answer a question wrong, your progress toward the completion
streak threshold will go backwards by one point. (And you will still
have to answer the question before you can continue!)
Note that once you have been given credit for the exercise, you cannot
lose it by answering more questions, even if you get some wrong.

Once you have credit for the question set, the "hide/show"
button above the exercise will turn green.

The multiple choice question sets work by randomly selecting from the
questions in that set.
It is possible that you will see the same question twice in that set,
and possibly even twice in a row.

Some of the questions have "hints" that you can get to help you
figure out the answer.
If you take a hint, you will not get credit for that question toward
completing the exercise.
However, you will not have your progress on the current streak set
back, either.

**Interactive Question Sets:** Some of the question sets are
interactive, in that that you will click on an array or other visual
element to answer the question.
They work the same way as the multiple choice sets,
in that there is a required streak number to complete successfully.

**Proficiency Exercises:**
Proficiency exercises are graded on a point system.
Each (logical) step that you do correctly in the proficiency exercise
gives you a point.
You need to get a set fraction of the total possible points to
complete the exercise.
Generally, if you make a mistake on a proficiency exercise, it will
tell you that you did the step wrong and correct it for you so that
you can continue on.
You will not get credit for that particular step
when you do it wrong, but you can get credit for the remaining steps.
Once you get credit for a proficiency exercise, the "hide/show"
button above the exercise will turn green.

**Settings Button:** The visualizations, slideshows, and proficiency
exercises usually have a button in the upper right corner with a
gear icon on it.
That will let you change some of the default settings,
such as the animation speed (usually used for things like the swap
steps in the sorting algorithm visualizations), or whether the arrays
show values or height bars.

**Important Tip:** Math is rendered using the MathJAX library, which
gives you a lot of options on how you can see things. Most
importantly, if you right click on any math equation, you will get a
context menu that include "Math Settings" with a sub-menu named "Zoom
Trigger". Under that, you can set zoome to "hover" (among other
options). From then on, when you use that browser on pages with
MathJAX equations, hovering over the equation will make it
larger. This can really help with reading some of the equations.
