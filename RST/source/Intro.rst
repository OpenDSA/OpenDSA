Preface

**Welcome to OpenDSA!**
OpenDSA is an open source to provide online course materials for 
Data Structures and Algorithms courses.
For this semester in CS3114, we will be using OpenDSA for Sorting and
Hashing.
Your OpenDSA "textbook" is made up of a series of modules.
Each module corresponds to roughly one section in a regular textbook.
OpenDSA content combines text and images with algorithm visualizations
for all of the algorithms and lots of interactive assessment exercises
so that you can tell if you really know what you have been reading.

**Supported browsers:** We support any reasonably recent version of
Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.
Unfortunately, we do not attempt to support Internet Explorer, and we
can pretty well guarentee that it won't work there.
At this time we have no plans to take any special effort to support
the non-standard requirements imposed by Internet Explorer.

**Registration and Accounts:**
To get credit for completing exercises and modules, you will need to
be logged in.
First you should register an account by clicking on the link in the
upper-right corner of any OpenDSA page.
The system will let you use any (unused) name and password for your
account, but we ask that you use your Virginia Tech PID for you
account name.
That will let us give you appropriate course credit for what you have
done.

Registration is simple, just click on the Registration link and fill
out the form.
Once you register, you will need to then click the "Login" button.
Once you log in, you should see your account name in the upper-right
corner.
You can log out by clicking on the logout link.
You shouldn't really need to logout unless you want another person to
be able to use the same computer to also access the OpenDSA materials
under another account.

**Overview of major elements:**
An OpenDSA module contains a number of interactive components intended
to help you learn the material, in addition to regular text and
graphics.
There are short slideshows that help explain steps of an
algorithm,
there are full Algorithm Visualizations that go through a complete
example of the algorithm,
there are "proficiency exercises" where you show the steps 
taken by an algorithm, and there are sets of questions.

**Getting credit:**
You can get completion credit for the following:
Going through a slideshow, completing a proficiency exercise, or
completing a question set.
You must be logged in to get credit.
If you go through the exercise and *then* log in, the system should
give you credit.

**Slideshows:**
Slideshows are controlled by the buttons at the top.
"<" and ">" buttons will back up or advance by one slide, while "<<"
and ">>" will take you to the beginning or end of the slideshow.
You get credit for a slideshow just for progressing to the end (one
step at a time).
A green checkmark should show up on the right when you get credit.

**Visualizations:**
While the slideshows are used to demonstrate a part of an algorithm on
a fixed input, the visualizations let you run the whole algorithm on
input that you can choose.
Generally these have some parameters that you can set (such as number
of elements in an input array, and the values of the input).
The "Run" button will start the visualization.
It will also restart the visualization with new data values if you did
not specify your own input.
"Reset" will typically clear all of the input fields and restart the
visualization.

**Question Sets:** Most modules finish with a collection of multiple
choice, True/False, or type-a-number questions.
To get credit for one of these exercises, you will have to correctly
answer some number of questions in a row (the exact number required is
different for each question set).
Once you have credit, the button above the exercise turns green.
You can still get more questions at that point if you would like more
practice.
There is also a "streak" bar that shows your current progress.
If you answer a question wrong, your progress toward the completion
streak threshold is reset to the beginning.
Note that once you have been given credit for the exercise, you cannot
lose it by answering more questions, even if you get some wrong.

The multiple choice question sets work by randomly selecting from a
set of questions in that set. It is possible that you will see the
same question twice in that set, and possibly even twice in a row.

Some of the questions have "hints" that you can get to help you
figure out the answer.
If you take a hint, you will not get credit for that question toward
completing the exercise.
However, you will not have your progress on the current streak set
back, either.

**Interactive Question Sets:** Some of the question sets are
interactive, in that that you will click on an array or other visual
element to answer the question.
They work the same way as the multiple choice sets, with a required
streak to complete successfully.

**Proficiency Exercises:**
Proficiency exercises are graded on a point system.
Each (logical) step that you do in the exercise gives you a point.
You need to get a set fraction of the total possible points to
complete the exercise.
Generally, if you make a mistake on a proficiency exercise, it will
tell you that you did the step wrong and correct it for you so that
you can continue on. You will not get credit for that particular step
when you do it wrong, but you can get credit for the remaining steps.
Once you complete the proficiency exercise correctly, the button above
it will turn green.

**Settings Button:** The visualizations, slideshows, and proficiency
exercises usually have a button in the upper left corner with some
gears on it. That will let you change some of the default settings,
such as the animation speed (usually used for things like the swap
steps in the sorting algorithm visualizations), or whether the arrays
show values or height bars.
