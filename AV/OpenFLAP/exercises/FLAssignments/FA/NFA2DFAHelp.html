      <h1>NFA to DFA Exercise Help</h1>

      <p>First you see "Choose a state to expand":
        Just click one of the nodes in the box on the right.</p>

      <p>That opens a box that says "Expand on what terminal?" There
        you type in one of the letters (terminals) in the alphabet. That
        would be a or b.</p>

      <p>Once you type the letter and click "OK", then you can do one
        of two things: You can click a spot in the box on the right
        where you want the node. Or you can click on an existing node if
        you want the transition to go to that. But if you click on an
        empty spot to create a new node, you next get asked: "Which
        group of NFA states will that go to on <terminal>?" So, you just
          type the state names, separated by commas. So, for example, you
          could type "q0, q1". That will place a node with that
          label. Note that if you type a list of states that already has a
          node, it will tell you that it already exists. In which case,
          just do it over again, clicking on the node this time as the
          target of the transition.</p>

      <p>If your node list is not correct (the exercise knows what the
        target node list ought to be for this transition), then it will tell
        you "State Label is incorrect". In which case, you need to figure
        out why your list was wrong, and then try again.</p>

      <p>At the end, if you think you did all the expansions, just hit
        "Grade".</p> 

      <p>This exercise is very forgiving. So long as you eventually
      reach the correct end it it is supposed to give you credit, no
      matter how many mistakes you make on the way.</p>
