      <ul>
        <li>First use the edit buttons to create a graph (nodes,
          edges, transitions on edges). Then click "Grade" to see if
          your FA passes the test cases.
        <li>The edit buttons are "Select", "Add Nodes", "Add Edges",
          "Delete", "Undo", and "Redo".
        <li>Click on "Add Nodes" and then click on the graph to add
          one or more new nodes.
        <li>Click on "Add Edges" and then drag from one node to
          another to add an edge. To add an edge from a node to
          itself, simply click once on the node in "Add Edges" mode.
          <ul>
            <li>If you have trouble adding the edge, it might be because
              you are dragging too fast after clicking the button, so that
              the system registers it as a drag event instead of a
              click. So, click on the source node and hold a half second
              before you drag to the target node.
            <li>Once you add the edge, a popup will let you add the
              transition by typing a symbol into the 'Transition"
              textbook. You can add more than one transition symbol to the
              edge by clicking the 'Add New Transition' button. To add a
              lambda transition, simply click outside the 'Transition'
              textbox before clicking 'Done'.
          </ul>
        <li>In "Select" mode, drag nodes to move them.
        <li>In "Select mode, click on a node to bring up an edit
          dialog to set start state, final state, or node label. Be
          careful not to move the cursor when you click, or else it
          will drag instead of trigger the editor popup.
        <li>You can also right-click a node to bring up an editor to
          set the start/final state or label.
        <li>In "Select" mode, click an edge to get an edit popup to
          set its transitions.
        <li>Click on the delete button and then on nodes, edges, or
          edge labels to delete. 
      </ul>
