Where does Horner's Method play into this? Horner's Method is an algorithm used to efficiently compute polynomials. Since our magic numbers are generated from polynomials, we obviously have a use for a more 'efficient' way of computing them.");

	rk_slideshow.umsg("Let us introduce Horner's Method. First off, we need to make it clear that a polynomial can be written the following way: \n\n(a_1) + (a_2)x + (a_3)x^2 + ... + (a_n)x^n === a + x(a_1 + x(a_2 + ... + x(a_(n-1) + a_n))). \n\nIf we understand that the previous statement is true, then the algorithm is pretty simple.");

	rk_slideshow.umsg("We will be using the alphabet {abc..yz} for this demonstration, and each letter will be labeled with a number: a = 0, b = 1 ... z = 25. This will make it easy to see how 'Magic Numbers' are computed given strings. To make it clear these numbers don't have to be precomputed in a table like we are seeing here. They just need to be unique, it would be perfectly acceptable to use the character's ascii value for example.");
