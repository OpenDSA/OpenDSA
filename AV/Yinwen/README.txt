This copy of TuringMachines.js adds support for automating
visualizations of TMs executed over input strings. The library version
(DataStructures/FLA/TuringMachines.js) needs to be updated to use
this. The TM editor also needs to be updated to provide this support.

Note that RST/en/VisFormalLang/Turing.rst is referencing this copy of
TuringMachines.js, and so its link will need to get updated when the
library is updated.
