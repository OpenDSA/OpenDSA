title: Constrcuting a problem with nested loops

instructions: Construct a program that first prints out 15, then 14, then 12, then 9 and finally 5 on consecutive lines.

initial:----------
MAX = 5
i = 0
while i < MAX:
    SUM = 0
    j = MAX
        SUM = SUM + j
        j = j - 1
    print(SUM)
    i = i + 1
