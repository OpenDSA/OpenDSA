This works by converting your language in question into a language which you already know is non-regular. This will lead to a contradiction.

(The goal is to construct $L'$ that you know is non-regular.)<br/>If $L$ were regular, and if we apply closed operations on $L$, then the result must be regular.<br/>However, $L'$ is non-regular. This is a contradiction.</br/>So, our assumption that $L$ is regular must be false. $L$ is non-regular.");
