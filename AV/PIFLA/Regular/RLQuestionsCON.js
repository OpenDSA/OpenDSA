  av.umsg("Recall that previously we briefly discussed the concept of <b>decideability</b>: Whether certain questions can be answered about a given system. Now we continue that discussion by considering some useful questions about regular languages. We are going to assume that the statement '$L$ is a regular language' means in particular that we know how to implement $L$ as a DFA, NFA, RegEx, or regular grammar, whichever we prefer. As you work through these questions, take a moment to see if you know how to answer each one before going to the next slide to see the answer.");

  av.umsg("Question 2. Given regular language $L$, can we determine if $L$ is empty?<br/><br/>Answer: Yes we can. Construct an FA for $L$. If there is a path from the start state to any final state, then $L$ is not empty.");

  av.umsg("So, these questions were all pretty easy, right? What is important to appreciate is that in other situations, these questions might be impossible to answer. Oddly enough, in some situations we <b>know</b> they are impossible to answer, and in others we <b>do not know</b> whether they are impossible to answer or not. For example, we <b>know</b> that it is not possible to tell in general if the output of any computer program is empty, or the same as some other computer program. (Oh, by the way, the set of 'computer programs' is just a set of strings, and so the set of computer programs is itself a language. It is not so unrelated then to ask these questions about computer programs!) And, we <b>do not know</b> if certain problems can be solved in polynomial time on a modern computer or not. We will address such questions toward the end of the semester.");
