Remove accept status from accept states in $M_1$, remove initial status from initial state in $M_2$. In our new PDA, we will start in $M_1$ and accept in $M_2$.<br/>3. Outgoing arcs from old accept states in $M_1$, change to end up in the cousin of its destination in $M_2$. This joins $M_1$ and $M_2$ into one PDA. There must be an outgoing arc since you must recognize both $a^nb^n$ and $a^nb^{2n}$. After reading $n$ $b$’s, $M$ must accept if no more $b$’s and continue if there are more $b$’s.<br/></br/>The last change is to modify all transitions that read a $b$ and have their destinations in $M_2$ to read a $c$ instead.");

This language is not a CFL.<br/><br/>(Well, we haven't actually proved yet that $\\{a^nb^nc^n \\mid n>0\\}$ is not a CFL. But trust us for now, we will prove this later. For now, hopefully it makes intuitive sense that a stack is not sufficient to keep track of whether the number of a's, b's, and c's all match.)<br/></br>This is a contradiction, so there is no DPDA for<br/>$L = \\{a^nb^n: n \\ge 1\\} \\cup \\{a^nb^{2n}: n \\ge 1\\}$.");
