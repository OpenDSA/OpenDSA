We said that we can't get at the a's that will be below the b's in the stack when we look at the second set of a's. Of course, a different type of memory might let us create a machine that recognizes this language. We will talk about this later. But for now, a stack is what we have. And for the good reason that this is what keeps us to <b>just</b> the CFLs. In other words, its not just a matter of recognizing more languages. We want to keep in sync with what a CFG is capable of. In other words, its not just a matter of not being able to create a PDA for this language. We can't create a CFG for it either!");

The other loop will empty the stack, but that cannot remove more than the number of symbols available on the stack at the time. So the lengths of the two loops are related.");

The has the effect of putting something onto the stack, and later removing it from the stack. Of course, any of $v$, $y$, or $x$ can be $\\lambda$ (but we can't allow both $v$ and $y$ to be $\\lambda$ because we would then have a useless production). And we don't have to take all symbols off the stack. For example, the language $L = \\{a^nb^m \\mid n > m\\}$ is a CFL.");
