We, therefore, proved the existence of some collection of stamps of size n with the desired property.",
        "quo2": "Some times, reducing the solution from size of n to n-1 makes prove a theorem more easily. Another advantage to thinking in terms of 'reducing from n' rather than 'building up from n−1' is that reducing is more like what we do when we write a recursive function. In recursion, we would naturally compute some function of n by calling the function (recursively) on n−1 and then using the result to compute the value for n.",

For example, a chessboard is two-colored. The following Figure shows a two-coloring for the plane with three lines. We will assume that the two colors to be used are black and white.",
