  av.umsg("An :term:`equivalence relation` is an especially important type of relation. Relation $R$ on set $S$ is an equivalence relation if it is <b>reflexive</b>, <b>symmetric</b>, and <b>transitive</b>. An equivalence relation can be viewed as partitioning a set into :term:`equivalence classes`. If two elements $a$ and $b$ are equivalent to each other, we write $a \\equiv b$. A :term:`partition` of a set $S$ is a collection of subsets that are :term:`disjoint` from each other (that is, they share no elements) and whose union is $S$. An equivalence relation on $S$ partitions the set into disjoint subsets whose elements are equivalent. The UNION/FIND algorithm efficiently maintains equivalence classes on a set. Two graph algorithms that make use of disjoint sets are :term:`connected component` finding and computing a :term:`minimal-cost spanning tree`.");

  av.umsg("For the integers, $=$ is an equivalence relation that partitions each element into a distinct subset. In other words, for any integer $a$, three things are true. (1) $a = a$, (2) if $a = b$ then $b = a$, and (3) if $a = b$ and $b = c$, then $a = c$.<br/><br/>Of course, for distinct integers $a$, $b$, and $c$, there are never cases where $ a = b$, $b = a$, or $b = c$. So the requirements for symmetry and transitivity are never violated, and therefore the relation is symmetric and transitive.");

  av.umsg("A binary relation is called a :term:`partial order` if it is antisymmetric and transitive. If the relation is reflexive, it is called a :term:`non-strict partial order`. If the relation is irreflexive, it is called a :term:`strict partial order`. The set on which the partial order is defined is called a :term:`partially ordered set` or a :term:`poset`. Elements $x$ and $y$ of a set are :term:`comparable` under a given relation $R$ if either $xRy$ or $yRx$. If every pair of distinct elements in a partial order are comparable, then the order is called a :term:`total order` or :term:`linear order`.");

  av.umsg("For the integers, relations $<$ and $\\leq$ define partial orders. Operation $<$ is a total order because, for every pair of integers $x$ and $y$ such that $x \\neq y$, either $x < y$ or $y < x$. Likewise, $\\leq$ is a total order because, for every pair of integers $x$ and $y$ such that $x \\neq y$, either $x \\leq y$ or $y \\leq x$.");

  // Frame 9
  av.umsg("For the powerset of the integers, the subset operator defines a partial order (because it is antisymmetric and transitive). For example, $\\{1, 2\\} \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. However, sets $\\{1, 2\\}$ and $\\{1, 3\\}$ are not comparable by the subset operator, because neither is a subset of the other. Therefore, the subset operator does not define a total order on the powerset of the integers.");
