        "description": "OK, so if we have a NFA, we might want to convert it to a DFA. For one thing, NFAs are relatively expensive to operate, in that we have to simulate them by trying all of the multiple paths that the NFA can take. But remember how the algorithm works to convert a NFA to the equivalent DFA. Can you immagine how big maybe the resulting DFA will be?",
