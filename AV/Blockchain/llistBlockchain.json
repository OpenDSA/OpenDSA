      "sc1": "Here is an example of what the start of a blockchain (the genesis block) might look like. The first hash is all zeroes. Between the block number and the hash, the block might hold any information.",
      "sc2": "The idea of the blockchain is that every block combines the hash of the preceding block in addition to its own data when computing its own hash. So, each block stores the previous hash, whatever local data needed by the application, possibly a nonce if the application uses that, and the resulting hash generated from those. In this example, these values are concatenated in order and hashed using SHA-256.",
      "sc3": "In Bitcoin, the nonce is the foundation of block production. Given a publicly known previous hash, block number, and data message, a nonce can be mined so that the resulting hash begins with some predetermined number of zeroes (in our case: four). It takes work to come up with the nonce (basically, keep gussing numbers until something works). This is considered a feature of the Bitcoin system that a brute-force method must be used in order to find an acceptable nonce value (called 'proof of work').",
      "sc4": "Here we have mined the nonce and produced a hash derived from the previous hash, data message, and nonce such that the hash begins with four zeroes.",
      "sc5": "The process then repeats when a new data message needs to be recorded and publicly released (meaning, added to the blockchain).",
      "sc6": "From this example, we can see what would happen if somebody tried to manipulate past blocks in the blockchain. The hash pointers won't match from the changed blocks on!"
