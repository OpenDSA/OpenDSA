          <p> Why does proof of stake use less energy than a proof of work system? </p>
          <div class="solution"> Currency collection does not take high computing power. </div>
          <ul class="choices" >
            <li> Proof of stake algorithms use the computing power to mine cryptocurrency. </li>
            <li> Users with higher concentrations of cryptocurrency prevent others from forging their own cryptocurrency. </li>
            <li> Proof of stake users need powerful computing machines to put stake into the system. </li>
          </ul>

          <div class="hints">
            <p>Look at each section in Proof of Stake versus Proof of Work.</p>
