          <p class="question"> The composite design pattern is most
            appropriate when:</p>
          <div class="solution">We are likely to modify the program to add new object types, but the basic operations stay the same.</div>
          <ul class="choices">
            <li>We are likely to modify the program to add new operations, but the basic object types stay the same.</li>
            <li>We need to encapulate and make interchangeable a set of alternative actions that might be performed as part of some larger activity.</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="hints">
            <p>The standard "tree in control" design is good when we need
              to add operations to an unchanging class hierarchy.</p>
            <p>Composite is not about interchangeable actions.</p>
            <p>In contrast to "tree in control", composite is good when
              the class hierarchy is likely to change.</p>
