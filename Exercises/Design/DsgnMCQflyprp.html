            property of a flyweight?</p>

            <li>It is stateless</li>

            <p>There is only one copy of the flyweight (that is shared).</p>
            <p>Since a flyweight is reused, the implementor cannot count
              on its ability to store state (since all occurrances are the
              same.</p>
            <p>It doesn't matter how big the flyweight is.</p>
