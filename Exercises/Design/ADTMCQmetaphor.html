          <p class="question">In computer science a <em>metaphor</em> is:</p>
          <div class="solution">A label applied to a group of concepts</div>
          <ul class="choices">
            <li>A figure of speech in which a phrase is applied to an object to which it is not literally applicable</li>
            <li>The model of a type</li>
            <li>A comparison that does not use the word 'like'</li>

            <p>In English a metaphore may refer to a word ot a phrase, but this is not how the word is used in computer science.
            </p>
            <p>The model of a type is another term for an ADT.</p>
            <p>In computer science a metaphor is more than a comparison.</p>
