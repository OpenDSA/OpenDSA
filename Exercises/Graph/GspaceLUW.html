          <p class="question">Assume for an undirected graph with <var>numV</var>
            vertices and <var>numE</var> edges that a vertex index requires
            <var>vertB</var> bytes, a pointer requires <var>pointerB</var>
            bytes, and that edge weights require <var>edgeB</var> bytes.
            Since the graph is undirected, each undirected edge is
            represented by two directed edges.
            Calculate the byte requirements for an adjacency list.
          </p>

          <div class="hints">
            <p> Adjacency list has an array (of size |V|) which points
              to a list of edges.</p>
            <p>Every edge appears twice on the list (the graph is
              undirected, so we need the directed edge in each
              direction). And for each edge there  has to be a vertex
              ID, a weight, and a  pointer to the next edge.</p>
