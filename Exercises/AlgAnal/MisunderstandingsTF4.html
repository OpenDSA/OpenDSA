          <p class="question">The lower bound for the cost of sequential search
            is <code>\Omega(1)</code> because this is the running
            time of the algorithm in the best case.
          </p>

          <ul class="choices" data-category="true">
            <li>True</li>

            <p>Upper/lower bounds define the growth rate in a particular
              situation (such as worst or best case).</p>
            <p>So the statement is badly worded. It is true that
              the lower bound in all cases is <code>\Omega(1)</code>
              (it always requires at least one unit of time). But the
              reason is certainly not <b>because</b> there happens to be a
              situation where the algorithm is cheap to run.
              In other situations it is not so cheap.</p>
            <p>Proper wording: The lower bound for the cost of
              sequential search in the best case
              is <code>\Omega(1)</code>.</p>
