          <p class="question">For sequential search, the best case occurs when:</p>
          <div class="solution">The search target is near the front of the array</div>
          <ul class="choices">
            <li>The array is small</li>
            <li>The algorithm is implemented efficiently</li>
            <li>The search key is small</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="hints">
            <p>It is a serious misunderstanding of algorithm analysis to
              think that best case is related to input size. The array
              being small has nothing to do with what is the best case
              input (of a given size).</p>
            <p>Implementation of an algorithm (as a program) has nothing
              to do with the algorithm's best case.</p>
            <p>Since sequential search can be used on an unsorted array,
              the value for the search key (large or small) might have
              nothing to do with where the record with that key will be in
              the array.</p>
