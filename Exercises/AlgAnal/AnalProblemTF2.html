          <p class="question">The lower bound in the worst case for the
            problem of searching an unsorted array is <code>\Omega(n)</code>
            because this is the worst case cost of the sequential search
            algorithm.
          </p>

          <ul class="choices" data-category="true">
            <li>True</li>
            <li>False</li>

          <div class="hints">
            <p>While it is true that sequential search
              is <code>\Omega(n)</code> in the worst case, this is not the
              whole story.</p>
            <p>Just because the best algorithm that we happen to know has
              a certain cost, that does not mean that there is no better
              algorithm.</p>
            <p>The reason that search in an unsorted array has a lower
              bound of <code>\Omega(n)</code> is because we can prove that
              any algorithm MUST look at every element (in some
              order) in the worst case.</p>
