          <p class="question">If we know that algorithm X is <code>\Theta(n)</code> in
            the average case, then what can we say about
            its TIGHTEST upper bound?</p>
          <div class="solution">It is <code>O(n)</code> in the average case.</div>
          <ul class="choices">
            <li>It is <code>O(n)</code> or greater in the average case, but we don't have enough information to say more.</li>
            <li>It is <code>O(n)</code> or less in the average case, but we don't have enough information to say more.</li>

            <p>What is the definition of <code>\Theta(n)</code>?</p>
            <p>Being <code>\Theta(n)</code> means that we know a tight
              bound (both the upper and the lower bounds match).</p>
            <p>If X is <code>\Theta(n)</code>, then it is
              both <code>O(n)</code> and <code>\Omega(n)</code>.
