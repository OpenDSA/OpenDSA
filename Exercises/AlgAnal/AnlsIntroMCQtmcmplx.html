          <p class="question"> Suppose that a particular algorithm has
            time complexity <code> T(n) = 3 \times 2^n </code> and that executing
            an implementation of it on a particular machine
            takes <code>t </code> seconds for <code>n</code> inputs. Now
            suppose that we are presented with a machine that is 64 times as
            fast. How many inputs could we process on the new machine
            in <code>t</code> seconds? </p>
          <p class="solution"><code>n+6</code></p>
          <ul class="choices">
            <li><code>6</code></li>
            <li><code>3</code></li>
            <li><code>3n</code></li>
            <li><code>6n</code></li>
            <li><code>n^2</code></li>
            <li><code>n+3</code></li>
            <li><code>64</code></li>
            <li><code>64n</code></li>
          </ul>
          <div class="hints">
            <p>This problem has an exponential growth rate. The behavior
              of an exponential growth rate is different from a polynomial
              growth rate.</p>
            <p>With a polynomial growth rate, a faster computer leads to a
              new problem size that is bigger by some factor multiplied by
              the original problem size that can done in the same amount
              of time.</p>
            <p>But with an exponential growth rate, we only get an
              additive improvement.</p>
            <p>Regardless of the value of <code>t</code>, the machine that
              is 64 times faster can only do a problem size that is 6
              larger in the same amount of time
              (because <code>\log 64 = 6</code>).</p>
