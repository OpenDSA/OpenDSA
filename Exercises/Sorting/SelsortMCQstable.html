      <p class="question">
	Which statement best characterizes
	Selection Sort (as the code is written in this module)?
	Recall that a stable sorting algorithm maintains the relative
	order of records with equal keys.</p>
      <div class="solution"><var>"Selection Sort is not stable, but with minor modifications it could be made so"</var></div>
      <ul class="choices">
	<li><var>"Selection Sort is stable"</var></li>
	<li><var>"Selection Sort is not stable"</var></li>
      </ul>
      <div class="hints">
        <p>Think of the behaviour of every pass through the inner
	   for loop of Selection Sort if two records are equal, with
	   the greatest value in the array.</p>
        <p>Which record will be selected?</p>
	<p>The first such record.</p>
	<p>It will be moved to the last position in the array, putting
	it out of order with other equal-valued records.</p>
	<p> But we could easily change the maximum-finding part of the
	loop to take the last of these equal-valued records.</p>
