          <p class="question">
            Which statement best characterizes
            Selection Sort (as the code is written in this module)?
            Recall that a stable sorting algorithm maintains the relative
            order of records with equal keys.</p>
          <div class="solution">Selection Sort is not stable, but with
            minor modifications it could be made so</div>
          <ul class="choices">
            <li>Selection Sort is stable</li>
            <li>Selection Sort is not stable</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="hints">
            <p>Think of the behaviour of every pass through the inner
              for loop of Selection Sort if two records are equal, with
              the greatest value in the array.</p>
            <p>Which record will be selected?</p>
            <p>The first such record.</p>
            <p>It will be moved to the last position in the array, putting
              it out of order with other equal-valued records.</p>
            <p> But we could easily change the maximum-finding part of the
              loop to take the last of these equal-valued records.</p>
