          <p class="question">What is the best case input for Shellsort?</p>
          <div class="solution">A sorted array because each sublist is
            sorted in linear time</div>
          <ul class="choices">
            <li>A reverse sorted array because because all the sublists
              are sorted in linear time</li>
            <li>A random array, without too much order or dis-order, which
              will keep things balanced</li>
            <li>It doesn't matter, all inputs of a given size will cost the same</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="hints">
            <p>The order of the input does affect the cost.</p>
            <p>Remember what sort is used for sorting the sublists.</p>
            <p>Insertion sort is used to sort the sublists.</p>
            <p>Insertion sort's best case is when the input is ordered</p>
            <p>If the input to Shellsort is ordered, than the input to
              each call to Insertion sort on the sublists will also be
              ordered.</p>
