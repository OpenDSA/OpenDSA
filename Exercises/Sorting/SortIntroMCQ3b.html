          <p class="question">Which of these is a traditional measure for
            the cost of a sorting algorithm?</p>

            <li>The number of records</li>

            <p>This question does not ask what AFFECTS the cost. It
              asks what is a MEASURE of the cost.</p>
            <p>The number of records affects the cost, but it does not
              measure the cost.</p>
            <p>The memory size affects the cost, but it does not measure the cost.</p>
            <p>Records being out of order can increase the cost, but not measure it.</p>
