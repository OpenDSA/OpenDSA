          <p class="question">In which case might the number of
            comparisons NOT be a good representation of the cost for a
            sorting algorithm?</p>
          <div class="solution">When we are comparing strings of
            widely varying length</div>
          <ul class="choices">
            <li>When there are lots of records</li>
            <li>When the CPU is really fast</li>

            <p>CPU speed would affect all comparisons in the same way.</p>
            <p>Number of records or amount of space won't affect the
              value of counting comparisons.</p>
            <p>The longer the string, the longer it takes to compare.</p>
