          <div class="solution">When a record with key value greater than
            the current record's key appears before it in the array</div>
          <ul class="choices" >

            <p>We have not used "inversion" to refer to a type of sort.</p>
            <p>While "inversions" are related to swaps (since ultimately a
              swap is needed to undo an inversion), it is not a swap.</p>
            <p>Inversion refers to an instance of a record being out of order.</p>
