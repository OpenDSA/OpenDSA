          <p class="question">In Shellsort, how are the sublists sorted?</p>
          <div class="solution">Using Insertion Sort because Shellsort
            generally makes each subarray reasonably close to sorted</div>
          <ul class="choices">
            <li>Using any sort that you like, it doesn't matter so long as they are sorted</li>
            <li>Using Quicksort, because this is generally the fastest sort</li>
            <li>Using bubble sort since that is the most appropriate sort in this situation</li>
            <li>Using Shellsort since this is a recursive algorithm</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="hints">
            <p>Shellsort isn't really recursive, is it?</p>
            <p>The sort that you use on sublists really does matter.</p>
            <p>Do you remember why Shellsort sorts sublists?</p>
            <p>Recall that the main purpose for sorting sublists in the
              first place is to make the list closer to sorted.</p>
            <p>Which sorting algorithm is fast when it sorts a list
              already nearly sorted?</p>
