      <p class="question">A disadvantage of Radix Sort is:</p>
      <div class="solution"><var>"It needs auxilliary storage beyond the input array"</var></div>
      <ul class="choices">
	<li><var>"It is not stable(i.e. records with equal-valued keys might not be in the same order in the output as they were in the input)"
	<li><var>"It is a quadratic time sort"</var></li>
	<li><var>"None of these answers"</var></li>	  	 
      </ul>
      <div class="hints">
	<p>Radix Sort is stable (otherwise, each digit's sort would mess
	up the previous digits).</p>
	<p>Radix Sort's time requirements depend on the number of
	records and the number of digits. When implemented properly,
	the number of digits is no worse than the log of the number of
	records.</p>
	<p>Radix Sort does need auxilliary storage.</p>
