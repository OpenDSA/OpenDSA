          <p class="question">When is Bubble Sort a good choice for sorting an array?</p>
          <div class="solution">There is no situation where Bubble
            Sort is the best choice over all of the others in this
            chapter</div> 
          <ul class="choices">
            <li>Each component of the array requires a large amount of memory</li>
            <li>Each component of the array requires a small amount of memory</li>
            <li>The array has only a few items out of place</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="hints">
            <p>Does Bubble Sort's cost vary with how much the input is out
              of order?</p>
            <p>Bubble Sort always does a lot of work, as compared to
              other sorting algorithms</p>
