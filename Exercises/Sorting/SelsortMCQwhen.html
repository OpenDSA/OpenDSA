          <p class="question">When is Selection Sort a good choice to
            use for sorting an array?</p>
          <div class="solution">When the cost of a swap is large, such
            as when the records are long strings</div>
          <ul class="choices">
            <li>When each component of the array requires a small amount of memory</li>
            <li>When the array has only a few elements out of place</li>
            <li>None of these answers</li>

          <div class="hints">
            <p>The big advantage of Selection Sort is that it keeps the
              number of swaps small.</p>
            <p>So it will make best use of this advantage when the cost to
              swap is large.</p>
