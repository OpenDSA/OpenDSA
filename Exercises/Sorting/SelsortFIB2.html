          <p class="question">Suppose that Selection Sort is given an
            input of 100 records, and it has completed <var>NUM</var>
            iterations of the main loop.
            How many records are now guaranteed to be in their final
            position (never to be moved again by the sort)?</p>
          <div class="solution" data-type="text"><var>NUM</var></div>
          <div class="hints">
            <p>On each pass, Selection Sort puts a record into its final
              position.</p>
            <p>So, if Selection Sort has done <var>NUM</var> passes, then
              at least <var>NUM</var> records are in their final positions.</p>
