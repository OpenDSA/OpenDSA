          <p class="question">Sometimes, the constant factors
            in an algorithm's runtime equation are more important
            thant its growth rate. When the problem is sorting, this
            can happen in which situation?</p>
          <div class="solution">When we are sorting lots of small
            groups of records.</div>
          <ul class="choices">
            <li>When there are lots of records</li>
            <li>When the CPU is really fast</li>
            <li>When the amount of available space is small</li>
            <li>When the records are nearly sorted</li>
            <li>When the records are nearly reverse sorted</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="hints">
            <p>CPU speed would affect all comparisons in the same way.</p>
            <p>Records being sorted or reverse sorted affects the
              growth rate of different algorithms differently. But
              not relevant to this question.</p>
            <p>When we sort only a few records, constants matter a lot.</p>
