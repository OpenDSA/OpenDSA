          <p class="question">When is Quicksort a good choice for sorting an array?</p>
          <div class="solution">In most standard situations where you want
            to sort many records</div>
          <ul class="choices" data-show="4" data-none="true">
            <li>Each record requires a large amount of memory</li>
            <li>Each record requires a small amount of memory</li>
            <li>The processor speed is fast</li>
            <li>We need a reasonably fast algorithm with a good worst case</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="hints">
            <p>Quicksort doesn't change its performance based on record
              size.</p>
            <p>What are Quicksort's average and worst case costs?</p>
            <p>Quicksort's strength is its average case cost, not its
              worst case cost.</p>
