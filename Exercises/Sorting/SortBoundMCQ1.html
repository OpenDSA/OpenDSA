      <p class="question">The upper bound for a problem is defined to be:</p>
      <div class="solution">
         <var>"The cost of the best algorithm that we know for the problem"</var>

        <ul class="choices">

      <div class="hints">
	<p>For a given problem, it is possible to write an algorithm
	that is as bad as we want. So defining a bound in terms of bad
	algorithms is not useful.</p>
	<p>We look at the worst-case input to determine the worst-case
	upper bound for an algorithm, not a problem.</p>
	<p>To get the upper bound for a problems, we
	compare the cost for each algorithm that we know.</p>
	<p>The upper bound of the problem is the upper bound of the
	best known algorithm.</p>
