          <p class="question">The upper bound for a problem is defined to be:</p>
          <div class="solution">The cost of the best algorithm that we know for the problem</div>
          <ul class="choices">
            <li>The cost of the worst algorithm that we know for the problem</li>
            <li>The same as the lower bound for the problem</li>
            <li>The cost of the worst case input for the problem</li>

            <p>For a given problem, it is possible to write an algorithm
              that is as bad as we want. So defining a bound in terms of bad
              algorithms is not useful.</p>
            <p>We look at the worst-case input to determine the worst-case
              upper bound for an algorithm, not a problem.</p>
            <p>To get the upper bound for a problems, we
              compare the cost for each algorithm that we know.</p>
            <p>The upper bound of the problem is the upper bound of the
              best known algorithm.</p>
