          <p class="question">If the upper and lower bounds for a problem meet then:</p>
          <div class="solution">We can say that we understand the runtime cost of the problem</div>
          <ul class="choices">
            <li>We are ready to implement the solution to the problem</li>
            <li>The universe explodes</li>
            <li>The problem is <code>\Theta(n)</code></li>

            <p>The universe hasn't exploded yet.</p>
            <p>Just because the bounds meet, it does not mean that the
              cost is <code>\Theta(n)</code>.</p>
            <p>We might need to implement an algorithm even if we are
              not certain that it is the best.</p>
            <p>When the bounds meet, then we know for certain if an
              algorithm to solve that problem is best (within a constant
              factor).</p>
