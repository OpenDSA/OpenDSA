          <p class="question">If we Shellsort an array of length 9, and we
            start with an increment size of 5, which element (if any) will be
            skipped on the first pass due to being in a sublist of only
            one element?</p>
          <div class="solution">4</div>
          <ul class="choices" data-category="true">
            <li>0</li>
            <li>1</li>
            <li>2</li>
            <li>3</li>

            <li><var>"No elements are skipped"</var></li>
          </ul>
          <div class="hints">
            <p>There is an element that is skipped due to being in a
              sublist of length 1.</p>
            <p>Recall that array indexing starts at 0, so the records are
              in positions 0 to 8.</p>
            <p>0 is paired with 5, 1 with 6, and so on.</p>
            <p>This means that the record in position 4 would have been
              paired with position 9 if there had been a position 9.</p>
