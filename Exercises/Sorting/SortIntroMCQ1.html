          <p class="question">Which of these is the best definition for a
            stable sorting algorithm?</p>
          <div class="solution">An algorithm that does not change the
            relative ordering of records with identical keys</div>
          <ul class="choices">
            <li>An algorithm that is as fast as the best one known</li>
            <li>An algorithm that always gives the right answer</li>
            <li>An algorithm that always gives the same order for
              duplicate keys from run to run</li>

            <p>"Stable" has nothing to do with how fast an algorithm is.</p>
            <p>It refers to maintaining the relative order of records
              with equal key values.</p>
            <p>In some applications, we require that records with equal
              key value preserve the relative order of those records.</p>
