          <p class="question">When is Insertion Sort a good choice for sorting an array?</p>
          <div class="solution">The array has only a few records out of sorted order</div>
          <ul class="choices" data-show="4">
            <li>Each record requires a large amount of memory</li>
            <li>Each record requires a small amount of memory</li>
            <li>The processor speed is fast</li>
            <li>The array contains many records</li>
            <li>None of these situations</li>
            <li>We need a reasonably fast algorithm with a good worst case</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="hints">
            <p>Remember that insertion sort implementation is made up
              of two nested for loops.</p> 
            <p>The outer for loop is executed <code>n-1</code> times.
              While the number of times the inner for loop executes depends
              on how many keys in positions 0 to <code>i-1</code> have a
              value less than that of the key in position i.</p>
