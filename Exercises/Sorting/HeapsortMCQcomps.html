            The order of the input records has what
            impact on the number of comparisons required by Heapsort
            (as presented in this module)?</p>
          <div class="solution">There is a constant factor difference</div>
          <ul class="choices">
            <li>None</li>
            <li>There is a big difference, the asymptotic running time can change</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="hints">
            <p>Can Heapsort's behavior change depending on outcome of
              a comparison?</p>
            <p>Yes, it changes things a little bit in that it might
              move things up and down the heap more or less.</p>
            <p>But this does not matter, because removing a value
              from the heap normally costs <code>\log n</code>.
