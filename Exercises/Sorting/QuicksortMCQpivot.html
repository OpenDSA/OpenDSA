          <p class="question">When selecting a pivot value, a simple thing
            to do is to always pick from the same place in the
            partition. If we use this approach, does it matter whether we
            always pick from the first position in the partition, the last
            position in the partition, or the middle position in the
            partition?</p>
          <div class="solution">It is much better to pick the middle value</div>
          <ul class="choices">
            <li>It is much better to pick the first value</li>
            <li>It is much better to pick the last value</li>
            <li>It doesn't really matter, they are all equally good or bad</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="hints">
            <p>If you pick the first or last one, then sorted input will
              give the worst case performance.</p>
            <p>If you pick the middle value, then it is still possible to
              get worst-case performance.</p>
            <p>But to do so requires a very specific and unusual
              permuation that will normally occur very rarely.</p>
            <p>If all permuations were equally likely, then it wouldn't
              matter. But in practice, the sorted input is much more likely
              to occur.</p>
