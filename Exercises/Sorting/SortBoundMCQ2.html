          <p class="question">The lower bound for a problem is defined to be:</p>
          <div class="solution">The best possible cost for any algorithm that solves the problem</div>
          <ul class="choices">
            <li>The cost of the best algorithm that we know for the problem</li>
            <li>The same as the upper bound for the problem</li>
            <li>The cost of the best case input for the problem</li>
            <li>The maximum cost that any algorithm to solve the problem could have</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="hints">
            <p>Upper and lower bounds are used to describe to what we
              know, and we do not always know that these are the same for
              a given algorithm.</p>
            <p>Lower bound refers to the class of inputs that we are
              considering (best, average, or worst-case). So it does NOT
              necessarily have anything to do with the best-case
              input.</p>
            <p>The cost of the best algorithm that we know sets a limit
              on the upper bound of the problem, not the lower bound.</p>
            <p>The lower bound refers to the best possible cost (for the
              class of inputs, such as worst-case) for ANY algorithm that
              solves the problem.</p>
