            <p class="question">
              A company wants to use a system where they randomly assign
              each customer a 9-digit ID (so there are 1 billion
              possible ID numbers). Of course, there is a chance that two
              customers will be assigned the same ID. But the company
              figures that risk is OK if the odds are only one in a
              million. They expect to assign IDs to 1000 customers.
              But the chance of collision is much higher than one in a
              million.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="solution"><var>"True"</var></div>
          <ul class="choices" data-category="true">
            <li>True</li>
            <li>False</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="hints">
            <p>While it is true that the last customer given an ID has
              about one chance in a million of sharing it with another
              customer (actually, the chance is 999/1,000,000,000 if 999 IDs
              are already assigned)...</p>
            <p>... this logic does not account for the fact that any of the
              previous 998 assignments might also have caused a
              collision.</p>
            <p>So the chance for a collision is rather higher than one in
              a million.</p>
