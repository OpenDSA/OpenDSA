          <p class="question">Which is true about deletion from a hash
            table using tombstones?</p>
          <div class="solution">It causes a slight increase in the
          average time to insert and search</div>
          <ul class="choices" data-category="true">
            <li>It causes a large decrease in the average time to insert and search</li>
            <li>It causes a slight decrease in the average time to insert and search</li>
            <li>It has no effect on the average time to insert and search</li>
            <li>It causes a slight increase in the average time to insert and search</li>
            <li>It causes a large increase in the average time to insert and search</li>

          <div class="hints">
            <p>The tombstones fill some slots of the table.</p>
            <p>While tombstone slots can be reused, they do have to be
              searched through.</p>
            <p>The fraction of hash table slots taken up by tombstones
            is normally not large, so while there is an increased
            cost, is is not large.</p>
