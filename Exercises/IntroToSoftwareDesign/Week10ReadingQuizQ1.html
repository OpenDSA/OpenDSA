          <p class="question">
            In which of the following situations might it be better to use a
            fixed-size array over another more flexible option, like ArrayList?
          </p>

          <div class="solution">A situation where you want to store a collection whose size won't change.</div>
          <ul class="choices" >

            <li>A situation where you don't know how many elements you'll be storing.</li>
            <li>A situation where flexibility is prioritized over memory efficiency</li>
            <li>A situation where we want to leverage the methods seen in the <tt>List</tt> interface</li>
