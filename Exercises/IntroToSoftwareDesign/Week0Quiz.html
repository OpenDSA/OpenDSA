          <p class="question">
            If I've already been reported for suspected cheating on one assignment, I should not worry about cheating on others ... after all, I can only get one F* for the course, right?
          </p>

          <div class="solution">False</div>
          <ul class="choices" >
            <li>True</li>

          </ul>
          <div class="hints">
            <p>Each assignment is typically reported as a separate violation. While students typically receive an F* for their first violation, the second offense normally results in expulsion (permanent dismissal) from the university, meaning that you will be removed as a student and will not be allowed to enroll again (or finish your degree).</p>

        <div id="ReadingQuiz1Q2">
          <p class="question">
          If I'm caught cheating, I will be notified:
          </p>

          <div class="solution">When the instructor detects the violation, or when the Office of Academic Integrity begins processing the report</div>
          <ul class="choices" >
            <li>Before the next assignment </li>
            <li>Within 2 weeks of the assignment  </li>
            <li>Immediately </li>
          </ul>
          <div class="hints">
            <p>Notification of students is at the discretion of the instructor. It may occur when the instructor reports the student, or it may happen later, once the Office of Academic Integrity contacts the student to gather more information. This may be long after the assignment is complete (in some cases, after the semester is over).</p>

            The typical penalty a student will receive for cheating on a programming assignment or a lab assignment is:

          <div class="solution">They will receive a grade of zero on the assignment </div>
          <ul class="choices" >
            <li>They will receive a "double-weighted" zero on the assignment (a zero that counts twice as much in their final grade calculation)</li>
            <li>They will receive an F in the course </li>
            <li>The instructor can choose what grade they will receive on the assignment, and in the course </li>
            <li>They will receive an F* grade (where the asterisk denotes it is due to academic misconduct)</li>

          <p class="question">
            You walk into the Undergraduate Learning Center in McBryde 106 and see two other students looking at each other's laptops as they openly discuss how they are solving the latest programming assignment. You should:

            <p>The official Honor System Policy states: "Actively deterring academic misconduct is, without reservation, the responsibility of all members of the Virginia Tech community. Apathy or acquiescence in the presence of academic misconduct is not a neutral act â€“ failure to confront and deter such behavior will reinforce, perpetuate, and enlarge the scope of such misconduct."</p>

          <p class="question">
            When starting to work on a programming assignment, you discussed how you'd solve it with one of your friends, and you both decided to work on it together. Later, you realize that because you've been working together, you have very similar solutions. You can:

          </ul>
          <div class="hints">
            <p>Unfortunately, by the time you have already worked together to create a similar solution, an Honor Code violation has already occurred. Attempting to disguise the shared work is only an attempt to cover up the problem and does not address the underlying situation.</p>
