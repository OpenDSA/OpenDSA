            True or False: A post-test loop has its controlling condition checked before its body is executed for the first time.

            <li>False; a prior-test loop has its controlling condition checked before its body is executed for the first time.</li>
            <li>True.</li>
            <li>False; a post-test loop never has its controlling condition checked. That's why they're so useless.</li>
