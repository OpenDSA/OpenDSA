          </p>

          <div class="solution">Subclasses inherit all of the methods and attributes from the class that they extend and a subclass has an "is-a" relationship with the class it extends.</div>
          <ul class="choices" >
            <li>A subclass will inherit the constructors from the class it extends and a subclass has an "is-a" relationship with the class it extends.</li>
            <li>If PlantingJeroo is a subclass of Jeroo, it will not inherit any of the methods in Jeroo</li>
            <li>If PlantingJeroo is a subclass of Jeroo, it will only inheret the constructor</li>
