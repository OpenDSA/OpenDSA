          </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
int[] nums = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4};
for (int number : nums)
{
   System.out.print(number + " ");
   System.out.println(number < 3 ? "is less than 3." : "is more than 3.");

          <p>What is printed to the terminal when the above code is executed? (Note: my math may be wrong....)</p>
