          <p class="problem">We define a "root-to-leaf path" to be any
            sequence of nodes in a tree starting with the root node and
            proceeding downward to a leaf.
            The "root-to-leaf path sum" for that path is the sum of
            all the nodes (including the root) along that path.
            Define an empty tree to contain no root-to-leaf
            paths (and so its sum is zero). Define a tree with one node
            to have a root-to-leaf path consisting of just the root (and
            so its sum is the value of the root).
            Given a binary tree and a value "sum", return true if the
            tree has some root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the
            values along the path equals "sum".
            Return false if no such path can be found.<br/>

            <p>If the root is null, and "sum" is zero, then we have success. To
              return True. Otherwise return False.</p>
            <p>We can't pass the sum of the path from the leaf coming up as the
              return value of the function, because we won't know which child's
              sum to use. So instead, we have to pass something useful DOWN the
              tree. In particular, call the children recursively by subtracting
              the root's value from "sum".</p>
            <p>The return value for any non-null node is simply true if and only
              if at least child returns true.</p>
