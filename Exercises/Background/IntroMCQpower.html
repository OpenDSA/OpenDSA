          <p class="question">As computers have become more powerful:</p>
          <div class="solution">We have used that additional computing power to tackle more complex problems</div>
          <ul class="choices">
            <li>The need for good algorithms has become less because processor speed can make up for a slow algorithm</li>
            <li>The algorithms have become easier to understand</li>
            <li>We are better able to use our everyday intuition to solve problems</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="hints">
            <p>Good solutions for large, complex computational problems usually
              require different approaches than what we do in everyday life.</p>
            <p>As problems that we try to solve grow more complicated,
              their solutions tend to grow more complicated.</p>
            <p>Processor speed cannot grow as fast as the cost of a slower
              algorithm applied to a bigger problem.</p>
            <p>As our computers have become more powerful, our history has
              been to apply them to more complex problems.</p>
