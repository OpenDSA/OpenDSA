          <p class="question">Which of these is NOT one of the three
            standard steps to follow when selecting a data structure to
            solve a problem?</p>
          <div class="solution">Run simulations to quantify the expected running time of the program</div>
          <ul class="choices">
            <li>Analyze your problem to determine the basic operations that must be supported</li>
            <li>Quantify the resource constraints for each operation</li>
            <li>Select the data structure that best meets the requirements determined in the prior steps of the process</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="hints">
            <p>Knowing the basic operations required to solve your problem
              is the first step to selecting a suitable data structure.</p>
            <p>Knowing the resource constraints for your problem's basic
              operations is the second step to selecting a suitable data
              structure.</p>
            <p>Once you know the basic operations and their resource
              constraints, then you can select a data structure that
              matches.</p>
            <p>Many problems do not require that you run simulations to
              determine the expected times for alternative solutions.</p>
