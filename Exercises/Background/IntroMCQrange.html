          <p class="question">A range query is:</p>
          <div class="solution">Where a record is returned if its relevant key value falls between a pair of values</div>
          <ul class="choices">
            <li>Where a record is returned if its unique identifier matches the search value</li>
            <li>Another name for any database query for a key value</li>
            <li>A way of efficiently locating the records in a database</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="hints">
            <p>A query to find the record that matches a unique identifier
              is called an exact-match query.</p>
            <p>There are many database queries that are not range
              queries.</p>
            <p> Whether a search is efficient or not has nothing to do
              with whether it is a range query or not.</p>
            <p>Returning a record that falls within a range is called a
              range query. </p>
