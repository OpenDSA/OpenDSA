          <p class="question">Why does function preorder2() presented in
            the Traversal module make only half as many recursive calls
            as function preorder()?</p>
          <div class="solution">Because half of the pointers are null</div>
          <ul class="choices">
            <li>Because there are half as many nodes</li>
            <li>Because there are half as many leaf nodes</li>
            <li>Because only internal nodes get called</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="hints">
            <p>All nodes will eventually get called</p>
            <p>The number of nodes in the tree does not change based on
              the algorithm used to traverse it.</p>
            <p>The Full Binary Tree Theorem tells us that roughly half of
              all pointers in a binary tree are null. No recursive call is
              made for these pointers by preorder2.</p>
