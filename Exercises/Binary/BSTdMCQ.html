            typically run in time O(d). What is d?</p>
          <div class="solution">The depth of the relevant node in the tree</div>
          <ul class="choices">
            <li>The number of divisions at each level</li>
            <li>The number of entries in each node</li>

            <p>Think about a given insert or search operation.</p>
            <p>How many nodes get looked at?</p>
            <p>The operation moves down the tree, looking at a node at
              each level that it visits.</p>
            <p>So the total work is the number of nodes that it visits,
              which is the same as the depth of the last node.</p>
