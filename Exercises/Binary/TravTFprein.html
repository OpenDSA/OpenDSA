          <p class="problem">Answer TRUE or FALSE.
          <p class="question">If you are given the order of the nodes as
            visited by a preorder traversal and the order of the nodes as
            visited by an inorder traversal, do you have enough
            information to reconstruct the original tree? Assume that the
            nodes all have unique values.</p>
          <div class="solution">True</div>
          <ul class="choices" data-category="true">
            <li>True</li>

            <p>Build yourself a small example tree of about 6 or 7
              nodes and see what happens.</p>
            <p>Consider the example where the root has value A. In the
              preorder traversal, that A is printed first. In the
              inorder traversal, the left subtree comes first, then the
              A, then the right subtree.</p>
            <p>From this information, we always know the root, the
              contents of its left subtree, and the contents of its
              right subtree.</p>
            <p>We can apply this concept recursively to reconstruct
              the left subtree and the right subtree.</p>
