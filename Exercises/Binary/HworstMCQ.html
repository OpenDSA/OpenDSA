          <p class="question">Which of these is a true statement about the
            worst-case time for operations on heaps?</p>
          <div class="solution">Both insertion and removal are better than linear</div>
          <ul class="choices">
            <li>Insertion is better than linear, but removal is not</li>
            <li>Removal is better than linear, but insertion is not</li>
            <li>Neither insertion nor removal are better than linear</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="hints">
            <p>Insert works by putting the new element at the end of
              the array, and moving it up the tree as appropriate.</p>
            <p>So its worst-case cost is proportional to the depth of the tree.</p>
            <p>Remove works swapping the element to remove with the
              one at the end of the array. Then move that moved item up
              or down the tree, as appropriate.</p>
            <p>So its worst-case cost is proportional to the depth of the tree.</p>
