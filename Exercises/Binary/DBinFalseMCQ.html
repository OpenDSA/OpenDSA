          <ul class="choices" data-show="5" data-none="true">
            <li>Every non-empty binary tree has exactly one root node</li>

            <p>Look carefully at the definition for a binary tree.</p>
            <p>It states that every binary tree is either empty, or it has
              a root node and two binary trees as children.</p>
            <p>So, every binary tree node has two children, but not every
              binary tree has a node.
