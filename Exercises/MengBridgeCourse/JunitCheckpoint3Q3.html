        <p class="question">Which of the following recommendations for
          testing software is good advice?</p>

        <div class="solution">Test each piece of your solution as you
          build it, so you will find errors as quickly as possible.</div>
        <ul class="choices">
        <li>Limit your test cases to one assertion, since each test should
          check only one expected outcome.</li>
        <li>Save your testing until after the solution is completely written,
          so you can concentrate solely on testing without distractions.</li>
        <li>Test a program with all possible values of input data.</li>
        <li>Longer tests that focus on combinations of multiple features are
          preferable, because they test your code more strenuously.</li>

        </ul>
        <div class="hints">
        <!-- Incrementally testing your code as you write it helps you
        find errors more quickly, and ensures that new work builds on previous
        work you have already confirmed works.  The other four choices here
        represent less effective or impractical advice.  -->
