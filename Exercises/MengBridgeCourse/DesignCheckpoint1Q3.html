          <strong>Review the scenario below then answer the questions which follow:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Case Study - e-Commerce solution (online storefront) for ABC Ltd.
          <br>
          You are required to produce a design for an e-commerce solution
          (online storefront) for the retail company ABC Ltd.
          <br>
          This design must take the form of a UML class diagram.
          High-level requirements have been provided below.
          <br>
          ABC will use the solution to promote and sell the thousands of
          products listed in ABC’s product catalog.  Though ABC expects to add
          other products in the near future the catalog currently includes
          books, DVDs, music CDs, apparel, consumer electronics, beauty products,
          kitchen items, jewelry, watches, garden items, and toys.
          <p>
          Potential customers must be able to visit the online storefront to:
          <ul>
            <li>- Search or browse ABC’s product catalog</li>
            <li>- View product details (including description, price, customer ratings and reviews, etc.)</li>
            <li>- Manage their shopping cart (add products to cart, remove products, etc.)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
          In addition, registered customers must be able to login, manage their
          user account, check out/place orders, and submit reviews of items
          previously purchased.  To register a customer user must complete and
          submit an online registration form, providing ABC with their email
          address, password, and one or more of each of the following, phone
          number, shipping address, billing address, and payment details.
          </p>
          ABC’s  customer service, order fulfillment, and other employee users
          must also be able to use the system to support business operations.
          
        <p class="question">  
          Which of the following could be considered an example of a
          non-functional requirement for this scenario?
