        This UML may represent the partial design for an
        Employee Management System (sometimes referred to as an
        Employee Information System or Human Resources Information System)
        for a business or organization.
        <br>
        Such systems are often used to support tracking and managing of
        employee information and related process.
        <br>
        This may including recruitment and applicant tracking, payroll
        administration, vacation and benefits administration, time and
        attendance management, training, and performance management.
        <br>
        An Employee Management System would need the ability to track
        and manage many different instances of the Employee objects
        (as well as many instances of <tt>Employee</tt> subclasses, such as
        <tt>ExternalContractor</tt>, <tt>PartTimeEmployee</tt>).
        </p>
        <p class="question">
        To accommodate this requirement the design should be amended to include:
        </p>


        <div class="solution">An appropriate data structure (or structures) for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing Employee data</div>
        <ul class="choices">
        <li>Nothing else is needed, the design is perfect as is!</li>
