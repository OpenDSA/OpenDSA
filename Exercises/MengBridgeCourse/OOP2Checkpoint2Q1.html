          The simplified UML diagram above shows the relationships among classes Bird, Crow, and Duck.

          Suppose Russell is an instance of Crow and Howard is an instance of Duck.
          Which of the following is incorrect?
        </p>

        <div class="solution">Crow is an instance of Bird</div>
        <ul class="choices">
        <li>Howard is an instance of Bird</li>
        <li>Russell has the capabilities and attributes of a Bird</li>
        <li>Bird is the superclass of Duck</li>
        <li>All Bird attributes are shared by Russell and Howard</li>

        </ul>
        <div class="hints">
        <!--A useful way to look at classes and instances is to use sets: a
        class describes a set of instances that share the same attributes and
        capabilities, and instantiating from a set produces a member of that
        set.  From this perspective, a class's superclass is a superset of that
        class, defined by attributes and capabilities that are subsets of those
        of the class.  So: all instances of a class are instances of all of its
        class's ancestors, and all instances of a class share the attributes
        and capabilities of that class.  So all but B are correct; B is
        incorrect because Crow is not an instance..-->
        <p>Reminder this is looking for you to identify the <strong>incorrect</strong> answer</p>
