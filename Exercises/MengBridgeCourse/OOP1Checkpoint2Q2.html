          The simplified UML diagram above shows the relationships among
          Java classes Bird, Crow, and Duck.

          Suppose Bird has a fly(Location place) method, but we want Crows to
          makeNoise() just before they take off and then behave like other
          Birds. Assuming Crows have a makeNoise() method, we should
        </p>

        <div class="solution">Define a fly method in Crow that just consists of <tt>makeNoise()</tt> and <tt>super.fly(place)</tt><br>
<tt>public void fly(Location place) {
   this.makeNoise();
   super.fly(place);
}</tt></div>

        <ul class="choices">
        <li>Define a fly method in Crow by copying the fly code from Bird  then adding in <tt>makeNoise()</tt> at the start, i.e.<br>
<tt>public void fly(Location place) {
   this.makeNoise();
 //  [paste the body of Bird's fly method here]
}/tt></li>

        <li>Define a fly method in Crow  that just consists of <tt>makeNoise()</tt>, i.e.<br>
<tt>public void fly(Location place) {
   this.makeNoise();
}</tt></li>

        <li>Define a fly method in Crow that just consists of <tt>makeNoise()</tt> and <tt>this.fly(place)</tt>, i.e.<br>
<tt>public void fly(Location place) {
   this.makeNoise();
   this.fly(place);
}</tt></li>

        <li>Define a fly method in Crow that just consists of <tt>makeNoise()</tt> and <tt>Bird.fly(place);</tt> i.e.<br>
<tt>public void fly(Location place) {
   this.makeNoise();
   Bird.fly(place);
}</tt></li>

        </ul>
        <div class="hints">
        <!--D is the best: super.fly(place) invokes Bird's fly method, so
        produces fly behavior like other Birds.  A would also work, but is does
        not take advantage of inheritance, and would be incorrect if you change
        the flying behavior of Birds by modifying Bird's fly method.

        B wouldn't involve any flight, C wouldn't terminate, and E assumes a
        static fly method in Bird (which would be unusual design, so I would
        have mentioned it).-->
