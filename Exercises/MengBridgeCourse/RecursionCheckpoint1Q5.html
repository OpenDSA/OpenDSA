        <p class="question">When we use recursion to solve a problem, we have:
        <br>
        1. a problem that contains one or more problems that are similar to itself
        <br>
        2. a version of the problem that is simple enough to be solved by itself, without recursion, and
        <br>
        3. a way of making the the problem simpler so that it is closer to (and ultimately the same as) the version in 2.
        <br><br>
        What is 2 called?

        <!-- Base case is the term we use for the case that is simple enough to
        solve directly.   We probably lifted the term from induction proofs
        in Mathematics, which is fitting.
