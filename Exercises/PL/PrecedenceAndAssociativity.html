          binary operators:

            and "order of precedence of operators."</p>
            <p>Review the direct connection between the associativity
            property of an operator and the recursive pattern in the
            production that defines the operator.</p>
            <p>Review the connection between the order of precedence
            of operators and their groupings into separate
            productions.</p>
            <p>Review the connection between the order of precedence
            of operators and how far down the parse tree each operator
            appears, that is, how many distinct non-terminals appear
            on the path from the start non-terminal to the operator.</p>
