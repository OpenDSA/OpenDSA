1.  var subst = function (n,o,t) {

          <p class="question">Suppose that you want a function that
          inserts its first argument <em>after</em> each occurrence of
          its second argument in its third argument, where that third
          argument must be a list. This could be accomplished by
          making a small change in the same line you identified in the
          previous problem. Now, assume that you have made that change
          to that line of the <span class="string">subst</span>
          function.  What further change would you have to perform to
          go from the "insert before" behavior to the "insert after"
          behavior?
          <div class="solution">Swap the first two arguments of
          two <span class="string">fp.cons</span> calls.
	  </div>
          <ul class="choices">
            <li>Swap an <span class="string">fp.cons</span> with an
            <span class="string">fp.hd</span>.</li>
            <li>Swap an <span class="string">fp.cons</span> with an
            <span class="string">fp.tl</span>.</li>
            <li>None of the other options.</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="hints">
	    <p>Make sure you understand what the new function is
	    supposed to compute and how it differs from both
	    the <span class="string">subst</span> function above and
	    the function that you wrote for the previous problem.</p>
	    <p>You may have to solve the previous problem again, which
          was to insert the first argument <em>before</em> each
          occurrence of the second argument in the third argument,
          where that third argument must be a list.</p>
