          <p class="question">Consider the following grammar for a
	    language
	    called <code>L</code>:<br /><span class="string">&lt;s&gt;
	    ::= a &lt;s&gt; a | b &lt;s&gt; b | &epsilon;</span><br />
	    <br /> Given that, for this problem,
	    a `palindrome' is defined as a string made of
	    an arbitrary number (including 0) of <code>a</code>s
	    and <code>b</code>s that reads the same backwards as it
	    does forwards, which one of the statements below is true?
	  </p>
          <div class="solution"> <code>L</code> contains only
             palindromes, but some palindromes do not belong
             to <code>L</code>.</div>
          <ul class="choices">
            <li><code>L</code> contains all of the palindromes, as
	      well as some strings that are not palindromes.</li>
            <li><code>L</code> is exactly the set of all
            palindromes.</li>
            <li><code>L</code> contains a finite number of
            palindromes.</li>
	    <li>None of the other options is true.</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="hints">
            <p>You can use structural induction (informally) to
            determine the truth value of some of these statements. </p>
            <p>One way to get started is to derive a few of the
            shortest strings in <code>L</code> and look for
            patterns.</p>
            <p>You can also consider each one of the strings of length
            0, 1, 2, etc., to determine which ones are
            not in <code>L</code> and why.</p>
