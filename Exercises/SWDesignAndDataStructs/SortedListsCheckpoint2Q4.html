          Implementing SortedLists using the class definition below would result in which of the following?
          <pre class="prettyprint">
          public class MySortedList> extends MyList implements SortedListInterface

          <li><tt>MySortedList would inherit all of the methods from SortedListInterface, methods unique to the MyList would need to be implemented, some inherited methods would need to be modified </tt></li>
