          <br>
          Using the information in the UML diagram above, suppose we execute the following Java statements:
        </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
Vehicle vehicle = new OilTanker(2500);
vehicle.move();</pre>
        <p>which definition of move will be executed?</p>


        <div class="solution">The one defined in <tt>OilTanker</tt></div>
        <ul class="choices">
        <li>The one defined in <tt>Truck</tt></li>
        <li>The one defined in <tt>Vehicle</tt></li>
        <li>The one defined in <tt>PeopleHauler</tt></li>

        </ul>
        <div class="hints">
          <!-- Since the actual type of vehicle is OilTanker, and since move is
          an appropriate method for instances of Vehicle, which is vehicle's
          declared type, the move method invocation will work, and will be the
          one defined in OilTanker -->
        <p><tt>PeopleHauler</tt> is an interface, it does not contain an implementation of <tt>move</tt></p>
