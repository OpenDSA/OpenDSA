Old merchants measured many commodities using weights and a two-pan balancea 
practice that continues in many parts of the world today. If you are using 
a limited set of weights, however, you can only measure certain quantities 
accurately. For example, suppose that you have only	two weights: 
a 1-ounce weight and a 3-ounce weight. With these you can	easily measure out 4 
ounces. You can also measure out 2 ounces by shifting the 1-ounce weight to the 
other side. determines whether it is possible to measure out the desired target 
amount with a given set of weights. The available weights are stored in a vector 
Weight. Each weight in the vector can be either: Put on the opposite side of the 
balance from the sample, put on the same side of the balance as the sample, 
or Left off the balance	entirely. For example, suppose that you have only 
two weights: a 1-ounce weight and a 3-ounce weight. With these you can easily 
measure out 4 ounces. It is somewhat more interesting to discover that you can 
also measure out  2 ounces by shifting the 1-ounce weight to the other side 2 
ounces by shifting the 1-ounce weight to the other side. 

Given the following recursive function signature, write the function code such 
that this function find out if a certain target weight can be measured or not<br />
