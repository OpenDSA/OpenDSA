            This is a still image of the concept map for the term
            "graph". You can check the actual concept map on the
            glossary page.<br>
            <img src="GraphCM.png" height="350" width="550" alt="Concept map centered on the idea of a graph. Shows types such as directed, undirected, weighted, unweighted, labeled, dense, sparse, and acyclic graphs. Includes components like vertices, edges, and neighbors, and implementations using adjacency lists or matrices. Also references related problems such as traversal, shortest paths, and topological sort."><br>
