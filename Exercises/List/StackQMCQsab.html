          <p class="question">Stack A has entries a, b, c (in that
            order with a on top), while Stack B is initially empty.
            When an entry is popped out of stack
            A, it can be printed immediately or pushed to stack B. When an
            entry is popped out of stack B, it can only be printed. Which of
            the following permutations of a, b, c is not possible to
            print?</p>
          <div class="solution">c a b</div>
          <ul class="choices">
            <li>b a c</li>
            <li>b c a</li>
            <li>a b c</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="hints">
            <p>We can manage to get "c" to print first.</p>
            <p>But to do so requires putting "a" and then "b" into
              stack B.<p>
            <p>Which then means that they must come out of B and be
              printed in reverse order.</p>
