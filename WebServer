# You cannot see the Khan Academy exercises or JSAV code objects
# in a browser directed to a local file unless you run a web
# server. In case you are on a machine (such as your own PC) without a
# web server running, here is a little python-based web server.
# You only need to have Python installed to run this.
# After invoking this script from ~OpenDSA, point your web browser to:
# http://127.0.0.1:8080/
# python -m SimpleHTTPServer
sudo python server.py 0.0.0.0:8080
